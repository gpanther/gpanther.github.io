                <p>Recently I&#8217;ve been looking around for a Java profiler (since the two
things you need for a successful performance tuning session are good
data and clear targets). I&#8217;ll share the notes about my findings in the
hope that they might be useful for someone. Quick disclaimer: don&#8217;t
believe everything you read on the Internet! These are my own findings /
experiences / opinions and they might not match yours. Also, they are
specific to this point in time. It is quite possible that later versions
of the given product fixes some / all of the problems I&#8217;ve experienced.
An other distinct possibility is that I&#8217;ve overlooked something. If this
is the case, please leave a comment and I&#8217;ll update the post <span class="caps">ASAP</span>.</p>
<p>Options I&#8217;ve eliminated&nbsp;completely:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="http://developer.amd.com/cpu/codeanalyst/codeanalystwindows/codesleuth/Pages/default.aspx"><span class="caps">AMD</span>
    CodeSleuth</a> -
    even though it is free as in freedom (open source), it has some
    serious shortcomings: it needs Windows (!) + Java 1.6 (might be a
    problem if you&#8217;re working with legacy apps) + Eclipse. Also, when
    I&#8217;ve tried to test it in a <span class="caps">VM</span> (VirtualBox running Windows <span class="caps">XP</span> on an
    Intel machine with <span class="caps">VT</span>-x enabled), it promptly bluescreend the
    machine (even though the documentation clearly says that you <em>do
    not</em> need an <span class="caps">AMD</span> processor to use&nbsp;it)</li>
<li><a href="http://jrat.sourceforge.net/">JRat</a>%20) - <span class="caps">FLOSS</span>, but it doesn&#8217;t
    seem to be developed actively and has a limited set of features (but
    it worked, never skipping a beat, when I&#8217;ve tried&nbsp;it)</li>
<li><a href="http://www.eclipse.org/tptp/%20">Eclipse <span class="caps">TPTP</span></a> (Test <span class="amp">&amp;</span> Performance
    Tools Platform) - Eclipse specific. I&#8217;ve tried to install two
    different versions under Windows and - even though the installation
    seemed successful both times - it didn&#8217;t function as expected (in
    fact, whenever I tried to launch an application in profile mode,
    Eclipse just&nbsp;hung)</li>
<li><a href="http://www.quest.com/jprobe/">JProbe</a> - Commercial, and it has a
    confusing licensing structure (I get easily confused - :-p)There are
    three components (Memory / Performance / Coverage Analysis) and each
    needs to be licensed&nbsp;separately&#8230;</li>
</ul>
<p>I narrowed down my choices to three&nbsp;possibilities:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="http://www.yourkit.com/">YourKit from YourKit <span class="caps">LLC</span></a></li>
<li><a href="http://www.ej-technologies.com/products/jprofiler/overview.html">JProfiler from&nbsp;ej-technologies</a></li>
<li><a href="http://profiler.netbeans.org/">the NetBeans profiler</a> (~~based on
    <a href="https://visualvm.dev.java.net/">VisualVM</a>~~ - I have been informed
    that in fact the reverse is true: VisualVM reuses the profiling code
    from&nbsp;NetBeans)</li>
</ul>
<p>Things they have in&nbsp;common:</p>
<ul>
<li>Multi-<span class="caps">OS</span> support (Windows / Linux / Mac /&nbsp;Solaris)</li>
<li>Multi-<span class="caps">IDE</span> support (IntelliJ, Eclipse, Netbeans) - with the exception
    of the NetBeans profiler, obviously&nbsp;:-)</li>
<li>Support for multiple / older versions of Java (again, important if
    you are working on a legacy project): 1.4 / 1.5 / 1.6 0 with the
    exception of the NetBeans profiler, ~~which is based on VisualVM~~
    shares the profiling code with Visual <span class="caps">VM</span>, and - although I couldn&#8217;t
    find any explicit mention about this in the NetBeans documentation,
    the VisualVM site has <a href="https://visualvm.dev.java.net/features.html#feature_matrix">a
    table</a>
    which shows that profiling is not available for older versions of
    the <span class="caps">JVM</span>. <em>Update</em>: I have been informed (see the comment below) that
    these are not in fact limitations of the NetBeans <span class="caps">IDE</span>, only of&nbsp;VisualVM</li>
<li>Support for remote profiling (again, with the - possible - exception
    of NetBeans - the same situation as&nbsp;above)</li>
<li>Memory / <span class="caps">CPU</span>&nbsp;profiling</li>
<li>Thread state monitoring (runnable / running / blocked /&nbsp;waiting)</li>
<li>Dynamic instrumentation (no recompilation&nbsp;needed)</li>
<li>Saving and comparing of&nbsp;snapshots</li>
</ul>
<p><span class="caps">CPU</span> profiling overhead (measured by micro-benchmark which calculated <span class="caps">PI</span>
with increasing&nbsp;precision):</p>
<ul>
<li>YourKit: \~5x&nbsp;slowdown</li>
<li>JProfiler: \~10x slowdown (remark: JProfiler has a nice feature
    which suggests methods to exclude after the first run - ie. methods
    from the base libraries which are very frequently called - to reduce
    the profiling&nbsp;overhead)</li>
<li>NetBeans / VisualVM:&nbsp;\~4x</li>
</ul>
<p>Remarks: these were &#8220;full profiling&#8221; results. Some profilers (JProfiler
for example) support an alternative method: taking a look at the current
stack for each threat at each N ms. This alternative method has a much
smaller overhead and most of the time gives the same relative result
(ie. the ranking of the most costly methods) even if the absolute times
are not as&nbsp;accurate.</p>
<p>YourKit&nbsp;details:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="http://www.yourkit.com/purchase/index.jsp#licensing_policy">http://www.yourkit.com/purchase/index.jsp#licensing_policy</a></li>
<li>It has the best integration with Eclipse from the&nbsp;three.</li>
<li>In the default setup it only shows the result after the application
    has (properly) ended. If the application terminates unexpectedly
    (for example you kill it), the results won&#8217;t be&nbsp;shown</li>
<li>It has no wizards for running user-specified Java programs (ie. from
    outside of the&nbsp;IDEs)</li>
<li>I&#8217;ve been informed that both of the previous shortcomings can be
    avoided by using the &#8220;remote&#8221; profiling feature (ie. by starting
    your program manually with the given agent). While this very well be
    true, it also sounds extremely&nbsp;cumbersome.</li>
<li>A possible advantage is that they also have a .<span class="caps">NET</span> profiler in
    addition to the Java profiler, so if your programmers regularly work
    in &#8220;both worlds&#8221;, or if you have distinct teams which do, you might
    be able to get a deal from them (I didn&#8217;t see anything on their site
    indicating that there was such an offer, but I imagine that it can
    be&nbsp;negotiated)</li>
</ul>
<p>JProfiler&nbsp;details:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="http://www.ej-technologies.com/buy/jprofiler/floating/volumeDiscounts?itemId=517127">http://www.ej-technologies.com/buy/jprofiler/floating/volumeDiscounts?itemId=517127</a></li>
<li>Has a simple wizard for starting&nbsp;applications</li>
<li>It was the only one from the three which could show the stacktrace
    for the threat <em>holding</em> the lock, not just for the one waiting for
    it (very important, since it removes a lot of the&nbsp;guesswork!)</li>
<li>It was the only one (out of the three) which threated locks from the
    java.util.concurrent.locks package the same as &#8220;synchronized&#8221; blocks
    (both in the thread view - where it correctly displayed &#8220;blocked&#8221;
    instead of &#8220;waiting&#8221; - and in the &#8220;monitor&#8221; view). The other
    profilers knew only about&nbsp;&#8220;synchronized&#8221;</li>
</ul>
<p>NetBeans&nbsp;details:</p>
<ul>
<li><span class="caps">FLOSS</span> (Free, Libre, Open source&nbsp;software)</li>
<li>It has a decent profiler ~~with all the essential functionalities
    based on VisualVM~~ - see the comment&nbsp;below</li>
<li>~~Unfortunately this means that it has the same limitations as the
    VisualVM technology: only local profiling on the 1.6 <span class="caps">JVM</span> is
    supported (this might or might not be a big deal for&nbsp;you)~~</li>
<li>I have been informed that NetBeans fully suppots older version of
    Java and also remote profiling&nbsp;scenarios.</li>
<li>One can use VisualVM directly, with the major advantage of being
    able to profile <em>any</em> local Java application in an ad-hoc manner
    (ie. the given application doesn&#8217;t even have to be started with a
    specific java agent, it is injected dynamically). There are of
    course some limitations (as with any technology): <span class="caps">AFAIK</span>, there are
    some limitations to the &#8220;visibility&#8221; of local Java applications
    (something along the lines of &#8220;has to be started under the same
    account&#8221;). Also, I found situations where VisualVM was unable to
    successfully instrument an application (and I&#8217;m not really sure
    about the reasons). In such cases support for &#8220;pre-instrumentation&#8221;
    would be&nbsp;nice.</li>
<li>Also, <a href="http://blogs.sun.com/nbprofiler/entry/visualvm_1_2_released">VisualVM 1.2 introduced the option to use a sampling
    profiler</a>
    for even lower&nbsp;overhead.</li>
</ul>
<p>Personal&nbsp;conclusions:</p>
<ul>
<li>JProfiler is the best money can buy (it seems that <a href="http://skillsmatter.com/podcast/cloud-grid/making-every-millisecond-count-jvm-performance-tuning-in-the-real-world">I&#8217;m not alone
    with this
    opinion</a>),
    but it is very expensive (especially the &#8220;floating&#8221; licenses - they
    are really useful because they allow the product to be installed on
    an arbitrary number of machines, but only N of them can be used at
    the same&nbsp;time)</li>
<li>YourKit is mediocre (from the point of view of the capabilities),
    but it is considerably less expensive (especially the floating&nbsp;licenses)</li>
<li>NetBeans is nice, if you already use NetBeans or you can convince
    people to use NetBeans. In fact it is comparable with YourKit with
    regards to the feature set ~~with the two restrictions of local
    profiling on 1.6~~ and it is free! Alternatively, you can use
    VisualVM if you are at the start of your profiling journey (for
    example: you don&#8217;t yet have the automated <span class="caps">QA</span> environment for
    performance regression&nbsp;testing).</li>
</ul>
<p><span class="caps">HTH</span></p>
<p><span class="caps">PS</span>. And remember: the two most important things for performance
optimization are: good data (collected by a profiler in an environment
which is as close to the production one as possible - there are a lot of
great profilers out there for many programming languages, for example
<a href="http://blog.timbunce.org/2009/12/24/nytprof-v3-worth-the-wait/">Devel::NYTProof</a>
for Perl) and clear goals (along the lines of &#8220;lower the latency by 10%&#8221;
or &#8220;increase the throughput by&nbsp;20%&#8221;).</p>
