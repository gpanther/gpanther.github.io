In the last couple of weeks I had at least two cases where I saw a
(provocative) post come up in my feedreader, click trough to read the
entire piece (<span class="caps">BTW</span>, partial feeds just suck!), just to find that the
owner removed the post. The first was from the DynDNS blog named “<a href="http://dyn.com/opendialogue">Open
Dialogue</a>” (apparently openness and
censorship can co-exists in some people’s minds, without having their
brains blown-up by the cognitive dissonance) and it said the&nbsp;following:</p>
<blockquote>
<h5>We hope we&#8217;re wrong, but it looks like <span class="caps">DNS</span> Made Easy (aka Tiggee <span class="caps">LLC</span>) is secretly behind&nbsp;DNSComparison.com</h5>
<p>Let’s first start off by providing some definitions of key attributes
that <a href="http://www.dyn.com">Dyn Inc.</a> lives by across our organization
and takes pride in while representing the <span class="caps">DNS</span> industry. These
characteristics define us and make us the company we are today. Call
us naïve, but we also “still” hold out hope that the rest of the <span class="caps">DNS</span>
space (and the business world, in general) believes the same and truly
means well when their actions might seem&nbsp;otherwise.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The second one comes from the <a href="http://maradns.blogspot.com/">MaraDNS
blog</a> (is there a pattern here? are there
many frustrated people in the <span class="caps">DNS</span> space?&nbsp;:-p):</p>
<blockquote>
<p><a href="http://maradns.blogspot.com/2010/05/xonotic-type-2-freetards-cant-make.html">Xonotic: Type 2 Freetards can’t make&nbsp;content</a></p>
<p>If you want to piss a type 2 freetard off, take an open-source
project, make it proprietary (after getting everything with copyright
to the code to agree to the non-<span class="caps">GPL</span> terms), and sell the proprietary
product.<br />
This happened with Tux Racer. Boy were the freetards pissed off,
whining about how the commercial game wasn’t very good, blah blah
blah. But, bottom line: The developers worked hard making the program.
They wanted to get paid for their work. The type 2 freetards felt
something was stolen from them because the next version of their
program was not open-source.<br />
Another successful open-source game is now doing the same thing:
Nexuiz, an excellent fun little first person shooter with everything
(both the engine <em>and</em> the content) under a <span class="caps">GPL</span>-compatible license.<br />
Well, the developers realized one day that they wanted to get paid for
their work, so they decided to have a remake of Nexuiz for consoles
that will be closed-sourced using different content.<br />
The freetards went ballistic. It became <a href="http://games.slashdot.org/story/10/03/22/1859212/Nexuiz-Founder-Licenses-It-For-Non-GPL-Use">a front page
story</a>
at <a href="http://slashdot.org">Freetard central</a>. In short order, a
<a href="http://www.xonotic.org/">fork</a> was declared. Freetards everywhere
talked about how evil Nexuiz was; their declarations were mainly based
on ignorance; inaccurate posts accusing the Nexuiz development team of
violating the <span class="caps">GPL</span> were posted everywhere.<br />
The next Nexuiz will, for the record, be 100% legal: All of the Nexuiz
code has been licensed for non-free use. The content will be, for the
most part, entirely new. There is no <span class="caps">GPL</span> violation here.<br />
Once the dust cleared, development on the fork (called Xonotic)
stalled. One developer <a href="http://forums.xonotic.org/showthread.php?tid=409">recently
admitted</a> that, two
months after declaring this fork,&nbsp;that</p>
</blockquote>
<p>It is my opinion that such actions inherently undermine the trust in a
person / brand. It is also ineffective (proven by the fact that at least
one person – ie. myself – was able to read the content). My ideal
publishing platform would&nbsp;be:</p>
<ul>
<li>Versioned, so that everyone could look up what the text looked like
    at a given moment in&nbsp;time</li>
<li>Verified by a third-party agency (such as a timestamp signing
    service) which guarantees that it had a certain content at given
    point in time (you don’t have to transmit the full text to such a
    service <span class="caps">BTW</span> – them signing a cryptographic hash is good&nbsp;enough)</li>
<li>Digitally signed by the&nbsp;author</li>
</ul>
<p>We all make mistakes. Lets act as grownups about it. Don’t try to wish
some things away. I understand that in some circumstances there are
legal obligations to take some things down, but at least post the
takedown reason in these cases (ie. “this post was taken down because of
allegedly defamatory content.&nbsp;sorry”).</p>
