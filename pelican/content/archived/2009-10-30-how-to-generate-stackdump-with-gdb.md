Iâ€™m not a big GDB guy, but [Google always
helps](http://forums13.itrc.hp.com/service/forums/questionanswer.do?admit=109447627+1256915915603+28353475&threadId=1005951):

-   Create a textfile with the following content:

        set height 0
        thread apply all bt
        detach
        quit

-   Run the following command:

        gdb $EXE -pid $PID -command $TEXTFILE > $OUTPUTFILE

    where:

    -   \$EXE is the path to the executable
    -   \$PID is the PID it is running under
    -   \$TEXTFILE is the file where your've saved the previous commands
    -   \$OUTPUTFILE is the file where you would like your stackdump to
        be saved.
