I’ve [written about
Grooveshark](http://hype-free.blogspot.com/2009/10/grooveshark.html) in
the past, however I want to mention them again for a couple of reasons:

First of all, they introduced a new user interface, which works great.
More than that, you can now seek in the songs! This means that
Grooveshark directly addresses three out of the five methods of music
use which I’ve enumerated in [my original
post](http://hype-free.blogspot.com/2009/10/grooveshark.html). There are
some small quirks (I don’t really like the popup-type controls, where
you first have to hover over it for the useful part to appear), but
those are just a matter of personal taste. They’ve also made it
available as a desktop application via Adobe Air (currently available
only for VIP subscribers).

Which brings me nicely to my second point: I’ve subscribed to their VIP
services. I thought that I’ve been using them for a month now and I’m
satisfied, so I should give something back aka. “Vote with my money”.
So, as of today, I’m a Grooveshark subscriber. A couple of things I
didn’t like about the subscription process: there is an additional tax
of 15% to the advertised 3 USD monthly price. Also, the subscription
payment is set as recurring by default. You can deactivate it later, but
even so, it made me feel a little uneasy. Still, I decided to give them
some of my money. Hopefully I won’t regret it.

As of now, I can only recommend Grooveshark to everybody! If something
happens, I will update this blogpost.

PS. I’ve also removed the last.fm widget from my blog. Currently
Grooveshark seems to be a much better deal than last.fm for
approximately the same amount of money.

*Disclaimer: I don’t receive anything from Grooveshark, I’m just a happy
subscriber.*
