If you need to "recover" your [RoTLD](http://www.rotld.ro/) password
when the .RO domain is registered trough Gandi.NET (I say "recover"
because you didn't set it in the first place :-)) - do this:

-   In the Gandi interface go to Account Management -\> Update account
    information and set "Anti-spam system" to No
-   Go to the [RoTLD password recovery
    page](https://domadmin2.rotld.ro/passwd_rec.html?lang=en) and reset
    your password. Now the password recovery email should have arrived
    to your inbox.
-   (Optional) go back to the Gandi interface and re-enable the
    anti-spam system

I needed to do this to enable [CloudFlare](cloudflare.com) on
[IT-Events.RO](http://it-events.ro) because RoTLD allows the changing of
nameservers only trough their website.
