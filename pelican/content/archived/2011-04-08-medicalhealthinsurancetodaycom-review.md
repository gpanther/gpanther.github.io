Today I'm reviewing a site which has the goal of comparing different
[private health insurance](http://medicalhealthinsurancetoday.com/)
companies and giving you the cheapest one. Unfortunately I'm not
familiar with the USA insurance rules (because I'm on a different
continent :-)), so I can only comment on generic impressions related to
this site:

-   The domain was registered in 2007, which is reassuring, however the
    registration information is hidden, which raises some questions,
    especially given the fact that you are supposed to trust this site
    with personal data (like address, phone number, date of birth, name)
-   The design is ok, although there are some technical glitches (like
    using the sitemap link to give the sitemap for the search engines,
    although this wouldn't be necessarry - there are [other
    ways](http://www.sitemaps.org/protocol.php#submit_robots) to point
    the search engines to it)

However the biggest downfall of the site is the confusing interaction
model and stale data: when you request a free quote it asks you *a lot*
of personal information (then again I don't know how much data the
individual insurance companies risk model needs) in a separate popup. It
presents the result in both the popup window (however both links it gave
me gave me an 404 error) and also the main window, but clicking trough
the main window requires to fill the form again.  
In conclusion I have a low confidence level that such comparison sites
would be a reliable information source and also the comparison on price
alone isn't enough when making such an important decision.
