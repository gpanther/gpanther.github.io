Sex sells, but in this case it is the reverse: money sold me to review
an [adult sex toys](http://www.adulttoys.com/adult-sex-toys/) website.
Here we go:

I didn't use any sextoys myself to-date (although I would be open to try
some of the lighter versions), but I can see how online shopping and
discreet delivery can be a big advantage. A word of caution: always
consider the medical implications and don't force yourself into
un-natural situations which could end up hurting you.

Getting back to the store at hand:

-   It only delivers inside of the USA, so it is a no-go for me (but
    there are plenty of local stores here, so I'm not complaining)
-   Their site interface is pretty well made and usable, but there are
    bugs: for example when added one product to the cart and tried to
    check out, it appeared twice in the cart
-   One big plus: their entire site is available trough
    [HTTPS](https://www.adulttoys.com/adult-sex-toys/vibrators/bullet-eggs/).
    Even though they default to HTTP, this is still great.
-   Unfortunately their contact details are a little sketchy (and I mean
    it in the literal sense: there is very little information): they
    don't give a physical address, just a PO box from San Diego. They
    are also hosted by a San Diego company, which makes it very probable
    that they are based there, but again, there is no clear indication
    of this. Their contact form doesn't give an email address or a phone
    number. They are hosted on a dedicated server (good) but with IIS
    6.0 (not so good). They are doing their own credit-card processing
    from what I've seen (I didn't go trough with an actual order) and I
    would be weary entrusting my credit-card to a company which is not
    specialized in this domain (the CC processing domain that is).
-   The site has no negatives on security rating sites like SiteAdvisor,
    WOT or Norton SafeWeb.

All in all, I would do only small purchases on this site, at least
initially, from a disposable credit-card (PayPal offers these for
example)

only post positive facts).*
