Branded affiliate programs are a great way to offer services to your
clients which are not your core competency (for example you are
web-design company but you would also like to offer hosting to your
clients so that they have a one-stop-solution experience). This is what
[VoIPstreet Affiliate
Program](http://www.voipstreet.com/affiliateprogram.html) does for VoIP:
you can resell a service to your customers which is fully branded with
your logo. The service provides [unlimited calls in the
USA](http://www.voipstreet.com/virtualPBX.html) and [all the features
you would expect from a
PBX](http://www.voipstreet.com/virtualPBX_features.html) (like
caller-id, transfers, on-hold music, etc). Other information you might
be interested in are the
[prices](http://www.voipstreet.com/virtualPBX_pricing.html) and the
[available phone
models](http://www.voipstreet.com/virtualPBX_phones.html). One thing
which I *couldn’t* find are the financial details of the affiliate
relation.

Are there any good? From searching around the interwebs I found some
[old (2007)
complaints](http://www.trixbox.org/forums/trixbox-forums/sip-and-iax-trunks-and-providers/voipstreet-problems),
but it seems that it was a problem with their data-center and I couldn’t
find newer complaints (which is a good sign). They also take part in
industry events like [IT Expo](http://www.tmcnet.com/voip/conference/),
whish means that they are definitely not a fly-by-night operation (one
has to be careful, since the VoIP space has a lot of fraudsters who use
cracked PBXs to offer cheap services).

*Full disclosure: this is a paid review from
[ReviewMe](http://www.reviewme.com/). Under the terms of the
understanding I was not obligated to skew my viewpoint in any way (ie.
only post positive facts).*
