[PHD Comics](http://www.phdcomics.com/) is always great and hilarious
(and worth to subscribe to if you are even vaguely related to the
academic world - like trough a friend of a friend :-)) but there are
those occasions when it is **epic**, like [this

The media can almost never be trusted to get things right and we should
get into the habit of questioning everything they deliver. Think for
yourself people, get a grip on basic math and logic and learn how to dig
up information!

raindrop](http://www.despair.com/ir.html) :-p.
