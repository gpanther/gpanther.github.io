With the motto “better late than never” here are some calls to action:

-   Vote for your favorite podcast on the [Podcast
    Awards](http://www.podcastawards.com/) website. Votes are open until
    November the 30th and you can vote once per day (after you vote, you
    can an email with a link, which you must click on to validate your
    vote – this is to reduce the number of “fake” votes). If you are
    unsure for which podcast to vote, here are some suggestions: in the
    “Best Video Podcast” category I would recommend [Buzz out
    loud](http://www.cnet.com/buzz-out-loud-podcast/?tag=bc) – it is a
    very good (informative and fun) daily tech-news podcast. In the
    “Business” category I would recommend [Career
    Tools](http://manager-tools.com/podcasts/career-tools)- it (together
    with its sister podcast [Manager Tools](http://manager-tools.com/))
    is a great resource. In the Technology category I would recommend
    [FLOSS Weekly](http://twit.tv/FLOSS) – it is a superb podcast for
    all people interested in free / libre / open-source software. And it
    would be a great gift for them for the 100th episode which is
    quickly approaching. And besides – TWIT already won a couple of
    times :-). So go ahead my ~~minions~~ readers, fly like the wind and
    vote!
-   And here is [a second poll related to Perl
    IDE’s](http://szabgab.com/blog/2009/11/1258270637.html): [What other
    technologies, languages, templating systems are you using besides
    Perl?](http://perlide.org/poll200911/)

After you have done your deed :-D, you can relax with two fun flash
games: [Little Wheel](http://www.fastgames.com/littlewheel.html), a fun
old-school point-and-click adventure game with very nice artwork
(including an interesting soundtrack). Or play
[nine-balls](http://www.fastgames.com/billiardblitz3-nineball.html). Let
the lightning be with you!
