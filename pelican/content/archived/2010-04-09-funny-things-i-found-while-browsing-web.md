The Geek/Nerd/Dork/Dweeb Venn Diagram (via Joel Esler’s blog):

BTW, here is a quick way to convert JPEGs which should be PNGs or GIFs
(because they aren’t photos!): simply use a photo editing software (like
the [GIMP](http://www.gimp.org/) or
[IrfanView](http://www.irfanview.com/) /
[Paint.NET](http://www.getpaint.net/)) and reduce the color depth
*without dithering*. This should pretty much get you there. You might
want to play around with the number of colors to retain.

The second one is [Pixels by Patrick
Jean](http://www.dailymotion.com/video/xcv6dv_pixels-by-patrick-jean_creation)
