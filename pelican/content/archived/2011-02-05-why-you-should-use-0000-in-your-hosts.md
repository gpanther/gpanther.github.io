Some time ago I (wow, time files!) [I
suggested](http://hype-free.blogspot.com/2009/07/speedy-hosts-blocklists.html)
that using 0.0.0.0 for host-file based blocklists would be faster than
using 127.0.0.1. Above you can see an other reason for using 0.0.0.0:
some applications take up port 80 on the localhost and accessing it can
(potentially) create havoc.

In the example above [TeamViewer](http://www.teamviewer.com/) (which is
quite a nice remote control application BTW â€“ with support for Linux!)
has taken it over and thus it displays a mock page instead of the
advertisement (which is very courteous).

PS. This was also mentioned in the original article, I just wanted to
give an other example.
