Do you like Linux? Do you listen to podcasts? If you've answered yes to
both of those questions, you should know what LUG Radio is (if not, do
[a quick checking](http://www.lugradio.org/) - I promise you that it
will be worth it!).

The bad news? They stopped it in 2008. The good news? A documentary
titled "Don't listen alone!" - a great title if I may say so - about it
just came out! So watch it below (sorry for splitting it up into 10
minute segments, but YouTube limits you to this):

Or go over to Jono's site [and watch it from
blip.tv](http://www.jonobacon.org/2009/11/04/dont-listen-alone-the-lugradio-documentary-now-available-online/)
(my problem with blip.tv is that their delivery method seems to be much
less bandwidth friendly - I've got constant "buffering" even on
connections where YouTube HQ clips play fine) or [download it from
archive.org](http://www.archive.org/details/Dont_Listen_Alone). You can
also read up on how the documentary was created (on Linux!)
[here](http://tonywhitmore.co.uk/blog/2009/11/04/dont-listen-alone/).

Finally, if you still miss their voices (as I do), head over to
[ShotOfJaq](http://shotofjaq.org/) or to [FLOSS
weekly](http://www.twit.tv/FLOSS) and you will be pleasantly surprised!

PS. Offtopic rant: I'm all for open formats and such, but when - after
days of searching! - I can't find a tool which supports the OGV
container (or the Theora codec for that matter) properly, I'm tempted to
give up on them! On the AVI/XVID/h264 side there is
[Avidemux](http://hype-free.blogspot.com/2009/02/free-open-source-cross-platform.html)
for example... Finally I had to re-encode the whole video into AVI/XVID
just be able to chomp it into 10 minute segments.
