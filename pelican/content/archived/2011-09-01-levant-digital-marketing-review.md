Levant Digital Marketing is a company which does [Search Engine
Optimization in the Middle
East](http://www.levantdigital.com/services/seooptimization/). They seem
to be a very new company (the domain was registered in January of 2011).
They are part of "JHG Holding", but this itself is also only from 2009
(and their site contains minimal content). I didn't manage to find their
headquarters on Google Maps either (but this might just be an issue with
Google Maps in foreign countries). Their phone number is indeed from
Lebanon (as their physical address is). Their facebook page is
non-existent at the moment (was it deleted?) and the twitter account is
completely empty.

All in all, while I couln't find anything explicitly negative about
them, it is more the case that I couldn't find anything concrete about
them :-). As far as advice goes, when starting out you are better off
with [some simple
steps](http://sixrevisions.com/web-development/10-seo-tips-to-remember-when-building-your-site/),
and when you grow you might consider looking into a SEO consultancy, but
take care to find a reputable one rather than a cheap one or one which
promises you the moon.
