There is a lot of talk out there about which is the "[Best Web
Hosting](http://www.alreadyhosting.com)" company.  
With such a highly contentious subject (since being the "best" means
more  
customers - and implicitly more money), there are a lot of
"authoritative sources"  
out there. One authoritative (without quotes!) source would be
[Netcraft](http://news.netcraft.com/), but  
then again, their statistics are somewhat limited in this space - it is
nice  
to know who were the fastest or who had the smallest downtime, but this
doesn't  
tell me anything about pricing, customer support and other services
(for example  
DDoS resistance/mitigation can be quite important these days!).

So, how to choose? I have just two words - very carefully. Have a clear
goal in  
mind (ie. "I want a CMS" or "I want a blog") and try not to
overestimate your  
needs (especially if it is a personal project). The most important
thing is to  
own a domain (yeah, I known, look who's talking) - which you can
redirect later  
on if you decide to move providers. I'm a great fan of niche/dedicate
hosting  
(like [Blogger](http://draft.blogger.com/home),
[Wordpress](http://wordpress.org/), or why not -
[Squarespace](http://www.squarespace.com/)). Given their specialization  
they can deliver their core competency very efficiently and securely
and very  
often free of for a low cost. The second best thing would be a
(managed) VPS  
and only in the last instance would I consider shared hosting.
