If you use Ubuntu, the [full circle
magazine](http://fullcirclemagazine.org/) is a great resource, go check
it out. For example from [the latest
issue](http://fullcirclemagazine.org/2010/01/01/a-new-year-a-new-decade-and-a-new-issue-32/)
I've learned that I should install
[vim-nox](http://packages.ubuntu.com/karmic/vim-nox) on my servers if I
want to upgrade my 1980's experience to 1990's :-).

I there is one (small) issue, it is the fact that the PDF is very CPU
intensive (I'm not really sure about the cause), but it is very good
looking and professionally done. Go look at it if you use Ubuntu. And
consider donating or writing an article or two :-)
