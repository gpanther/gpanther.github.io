Finding relatives was always a topic which interested me marginally, so
I was interested in checking out the Finders UK website (which BTW, can
also be read in other ways because URLs don’t have the concept of
capitalization implicitly – lets just leave at that). They offer
different services like [tracing heirs](http://www.findersuk.com).
Unfortunately (for me) their services are limited to the UK (then again,
it makes the company much more compelling, since supposedly a company
can offer the best services by specializing in one core competency).

They don’t have a public price offer, but this is understandable since
the amount of work involved can vary wildly between cases. All in all
this looks like a good company if you need such services in the UK (the
links on their webpage to different industry associations are all
legitimate, even though some of them a little out of date). They also
support two non-profit organizations: the Marie Curie Cancer care and
Missing People, which is very generous of them.

*Full disclosure: this is a paid review from
[ReviewMe](http://www.reviewme.com/). Under the terms of the
understanding I was not obligated to skew my viewpoint in any way (ie.
only post positive facts).*
