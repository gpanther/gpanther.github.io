Here are a couple of challenges I found on the interwebs:

-   [SSHliders](http://www.ethicalhacker.net/content/view/279/2/) – from
    ethicalhacker.net. This one is centered around \*nix shell scripting
    and more advanced topics like pipes.
-   [Hugi Size Coding Compo
    \#29](http://www.frontiernet.net/~fys/hugi/hcompo.htm) (from
    [Hugi](http://www.hugi.scene.org/main.php)) – not much time left
    there, the deadline is the 28th of October. No flashy prizes either,
    just the bragging rights that you’ve created something useful in
    less than 124 bytes (the current leader)

Also, the solution to the [Prison Break EH
challenge](http://hype-free.blogspot.com/2009/09/ethical-hacker-challenge-prison-break.html)
has been posted (on
[EH.net](http://www.ethicalhacker.net/content/view/278/2/) with
[additional videos on the radajo
blog](http://radajo.blogspot.com/2009/10/prison-break-breaking-entering-decoding.html)).
There is a lot of cool networking info in there, worth the read!

Have fun!
