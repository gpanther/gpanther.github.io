There are a couple of actions you can do with music you have on your
computer:

-   You can listen to an arbitrary song from your library
-   You can jump in the song you are listening to
-   You can share it with a friend
-   You can convert it and listen using an alternative format (ie. on
    your MP3 player, on your phone, in your car, etc)
-   You can edit it using [a sound
    editor](http://audacity.sourceforge.net/)

Thus, any service which aims to replace your music library should
provide as many of these options as possible. Recently I found out about
[Grooveshark](http://listen.grooveshark.com/) which provides all but the
last two of these actions *for free*! Additionally they have a very
slick interface and *you don’t even have to sign up to use the service*!

[![grooveshark](http://lh4.ggpht.com/_hrvCBhtWhJ4/Ss9O3D0IeVI/AAAAAAAAB9Q/Cy0-Z0K93M4/grooveshark_thumb%5B2%5D.png?imgmax=800 "grooveshark")](http://lh3.ggpht.com/_hrvCBhtWhJ4/Ss9O2vOVtuI/AAAAAAAAB9M/Lt9KYmJQ0Os/s1600-h/grooveshark%5B4%5D.png)

Additionally they provide an “auto-play” feature which adds “similar”
songs to your playlist and seems to work acceptably (is is no Pandora
though). An other thing I appreciate is the clear revenue model: it is
ad supported or you can become a premium member for as little as 3\$ /
month and see no ads. I don’t know if the numbers are right, but they
seem much more plausible than the one of
[Jango](http://hype-free.blogspot.com/2009/07/jango-review.html). I
don’t want to dish them, but their lack of business model (no premium
accounts!?) always concerned me and recently they seem to experiment
with a lot of things (like taking away the possibility of directly
playing a song and rather linking to Rhapsody) which is both annoying
and concerning. My only concern is the fact that I found this site via
the now defunct Seeqpod, which used (intentionally or unintentionally)
publicly available MP3 files to power their service. While Grooveshark
seems to use their own servers, rather than arbitrary hosts on the
Internet, the file name quality suggests that these files were
arbitrarily downloaded from different sources (public folders? P2P? –
who knows), a practice which might get them in hot water with the RIAA,
especially given that they seem to be based in the USA.

In conclusion: Grooveshark is great for now. Hopefully it will last in
its current (or better) form for a long time. Below you can see an
example of the embedded player:

*Update*: check out [the new Grooveshark
interface](http://hype-free.blogspot.com/2009/11/grooveshark-vip-member.html)!
It is very nice. Also, I'm a VIP subscriber to Grooveshark now!
