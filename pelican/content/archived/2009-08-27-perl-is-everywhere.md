Something which is not appreciated enough IMHO is just how much of the
interwebs runs on Perl: for example [Frozen
Bubble](http://www.frozen-bubble.org/) is [written in
Perl](http://szabgab.com/blog/2009/08/1250326938.html). Also, from some
error messages Iâ€™ve got the impression [Yahoo
Pipes](http://pipes.yahoo.com/) uses (is written in?) Perl.

And just before you accuse me of being a Perl fanboy (which I am BTW
:-p), here is a fascinating document: [Far More Than Everything You've
Ever Wanted to Know
about](http://www.perl.com/language/misc/fmproto.html).
