A very cool [visualization of the imigration / emigration
data](http://migrationsmap.net/#/JPN/departures):

To remember: the relative sizes of countries / continents on most maps
is not representative of the true ratios, because most [map
projections](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Map_projection) were not meant
for that. If you want to play around with different projections, here is
[a nice page from
Wolfram](http://demonstrations.wolfram.com/WorldMapProjections/)
(unfortunately you have to install a \~100MB plugin to get it to work).
If you need the raw data, just [go to
Wikipedia](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_countries_by_total_area_(graphical)).

Finally, here is a good essay from Asimov (from 1989) about the
scientific process: [The Relativity of
Wrong](http://chem.tufts.edu/AnswersInScience/RelativityofWrong.htm) -
small nitpick: it would have been even better if it had used the metric
system or at least it didn't switch from miles to inches in he middle of
the essay.
