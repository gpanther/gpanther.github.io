Inspired by [this
post](http://alexj.info/2012/11/15/open-source-software-on-windows/) I
decided to list the software I use/recommend under Windows.

Free/Libre Open Source Software:

-   [LibreOffice](http://www.libreoffice.org/) (for of OpenOffice) - a
    very capable office solution. Most people don't need anything more
    than this. If you are installing it for a non-technical user, make
    sure to set the default file formats to the Microsoft ones (.doc,
    .xls, ...)
-   [Far Manager](http://www.farmanager.com/opensource.php) - a very
    cool two-panel file manager, for those of us who like text-based
    things (don't let the looks fool you - it is very modern and very
    capable). You could also take a look at [NDN](http://ndn.muxe.com/)
    or [DNOSP](http://www.dnosp.com/), but FAR is my personal favorite.
-   [VLC](http://www.videolan.org/) - THE video player. It can play
    99.999% of the media out there and it won't pollute your system with
    all kinds of DLLs.
-   [ffdshow-tryouts](http://ffdshow-tryout.sourceforge.net/) -
    DirectShow / VFW codecs for all the formats VLC can play (in fact
    they are both based on the [ffmpeg](http://ffmpeg.org/) project).
    Use this to play back videos in programs which are DirectShow based
    (like WMP or Winamp).
-   [7-zip](http://www.7-zip.org/) - for all your zipping and unzipping
    needs. It supports a lot of other formats too (mainly for
    extracting) so no need to install the shareware version of WinRar
-   [Firefox](http://www.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/new/) - 'nuff said.
    There are also a lot of plugins which one might find useful like
    [Firebug](https://getfirebug.com/),
    [NoScript](http://noscript.net/),
    [RequestPolicy](https://www.requestpolicy.com/), etc. As a download
    manager I would recommend
    [DownThemAll](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/downthemall/),
    but I found that with recent increases in Internet access speeds I
    don't need a download manager.
-   [Notepad2](http://www.flos-freeware.ch/notepad2.html) for your small
    (text) editing needs. There is also
    [Notepad++](http://notepad-plus-plus.org/) and
    [notepad2-mod](http://xhmikosr.github.com/notepad2-mod/).
-   [PDFForge](http://www.pdfforge.org/) to create PDFs from any program
    which can print (it acts as a virtual printer which outputs its
    results to a PDF file). Sidenote: LibreOffice can natively save to
    PDF, no need for this if you're using it only for that.
-   [Pidgin](http://www.pidgin.im/) - you might know it as GAIM, a multi
    protocol instant messenger. And it is *very* multi protocol. The
    only downside is that some advanced protocol features are not always
    functional (\*cough\* file-transfer, \*cough\*), but I find that I
    rarely use those anyways. If you are installing it for someone else
    however, make sure to ask them what features they consider essential
    (like custom background/emoticons) and act accordingly.
-   [WinSCP](http://winscp.net/eng/index.php) to copy files trough
    SSH/SCP, and the [FileZilla client](http://filezilla-project.org/)
    to do the same over FTP.
-   Various specialized programs: [GIMP](http://www.gimp.org/) for
    photo-editing, [Inkscape](http://inkscape.org/) for vector-based
    graphics, [VirtualDub](http://www.virtualdub.org/) and
    [Avidemux](http://fixounet.free.fr/avidemux/) for (linear) video
    editing, [Wireshark](http://www.wireshark.org/) for network
    analysis, [Audacity](http://audacity.sourceforge.net/) for audio
    editing,
    [PuTTY](http://www.chiark.greenend.org.uk/~sgtatham/putty/download.html)
    as an SSH client, [VirtualBox](https://www.virtualbox.org/) for
    running virtual machines and [Eclipse](http://www.eclipse.org/) for
    development (it can do more than Java!). There is also the [IntelliJ
    Community Edition](http://www.jetbrains.com/idea/free_java_ide.html)
    for developement which *is* Open Source Software, but be aware of
    [the
    limitations](http://www.jetbrains.com/idea/features/editions_comparison_matrix.html).
-   [XAMPP](http://www.apachefriends.org/en/xampp.html) for quickly
    setting up a LAMP environment under Windows

Free (as in beer) - these may try to trick you into installing toolbars
/ changing your homepage / your search engine so watch out:

-   [TeamViewer](http://www.teamviewer.com/) - a nice remote control
    solution (also cross platform - although it doesn't run perfectly on
    other OSs). I especially like the fact that it can run as a service
    and that it takes care of the NAT traversal problem.
-   [CDBurnerXP](http://cdburnerxp.se/) - for burning optical media.
    Nothing special, but it works.
-   [IrfanView](http://www.irfanview.com/) - a very capable image viewer
    / converter. Don't forget to install the plugins to take full
    advantage of its features! It is also so lightweight that won't
    believe how quickly the installation finishes. Watch out though, it
    tries to install sponsored programs :-(
-   [FreeCommander](http://www.freecommander.com/) - a two panel graphic
    file manager. Recommended if you're a Total/Windows Commander fan
    rather than a Norton Commander one :-)
-   The [MS Visual Studio Express
    series](http://www.microsoft.com/visualstudio/eng/products/visual-studio-express-products) -
    a good way to get your feet wet with MS specific development (also
    good for university projects), but be aware that you'll quickly hit
    a wall with it on professional projects.
-   [uTorrent](http://www.utorrent.com/) for my downloading needs.
-   [Daemon Tools Free](http://www.daemon-tools.cc/eng/downloads) for my
    ISO (CD/DVD/BR) mounting needs. Attention during install! It will
    try to "upgrade" you several times during install and also try to
    install additional software / change your home page / search
    provider if you just click trough next. Don't let it, form a
    technical point of view it is a great product. There is also the
    unsupported [Virtual
    CD](http://www.softpedia.com/get/CD-DVD-Tools/Virtual-CD-DVD-Rom/Virtual-CDROM-Control-Panel.shtml)
    product from Microsoft and Windows can mount ISOs natively starting
    from Windows 7 I think.
-   The [FoxIt PDF
    Reader](http://www.foxitsoftware.com/downloads/index.php) - a
    lightweight PDF reader, although Adobe Reader X caught up nicely I
    feel (and they also auto-update to eliminate security
    vulnerabilities), so you could give it a second go.
-   [BB FlashBack Express](http://www.bbsoftware.co.uk/bbflashback.aspx)
    for screen recording. Little annoying to install (you need to give
    them an email account, they try to upgrade you to the paid version
    and you need to "register" afterwards), but after installing it is
    all good and I found it to be a very capable product (even at the
    free version level).
-   [Chrome](https://www.google.com/intl/en/chrome/browser/) and
    [Opera](http://www.opera.com/) as alternative browsers (and no,
    Chrome is not Open Source, Chromium is).
-   [Paint.NET](http://www.getpaint.net/) for advanced but "not
    photoshop level" image editing.
-   [foobar2000](http://www.foobar2000.org/) or
    [Winamp](http://www.winamp.com/) (with the classic skin :-)) for
    music. foobar is very lightweight and quick, but it might lack some
    features. Winamp is very complete, but tries to make all kinds of
    changes to your system. You also probably don't need the Winamp
    Agent to run in the background all the time :-)
-   [Dropbox](https://www.dropbox.com/) for file synchronization /
    small-scale file serving. Alternatively there is
    [SkyDrive](https://skydrive.live.com/), but it isn't very Linux
    friendly.
-   [Windows Live
    Writer](http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows-live/essentials-other-programs?T1=t4) -
    the best blog publishing software I could find. Unfortunately
    Microsoft ruined it with the Office 2007 look and now seems to want
    to abandon it completely
-   [Skype](http://www.skype.com/) for video-call / teleconference,
    although lately I've been dropping it in favor of Google Hangouts

*Update*: this software looks very promising:
[Ninite](http://ninite.com/). It purports to auto-install and
auto-update a lot of common Windows software. Will take it for a spin
the next time I install Windows.
