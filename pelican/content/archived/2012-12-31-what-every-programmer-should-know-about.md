Piggybacking on some memes floating around on the internet I would like
to publish my list of "what every programmer should know".

A couple of introductory words: in my opinion the two most important
things to learn for new programmers are terminology - to know what
things / ideas / algorithms / concepts are called so that they can
search for them on the internet and discuss their ideas) and humility
(if something doesn't exists or doesn't work the way we expected, the
first thing we should ask ourselves is: "what am I missing?" instead of
proclaiming the predecessors to be idiots). Moving along to the list:

-   [What every programmer should know about
    X](http://multimedia.cx/eggs/what-every-programmer-should-know/) -
    the Breaking Eggs And Making Omelettes blog contains a very eclectic
    list of articles. The only thing I would add is the [PDF link to
    "What every programmer should know about
    memory"](www.akkadia.org/drepper/cpumemory.pdf) rather than the LWN
    version. Also worth checking out the discussion in the comments.
-   [Latency numbers every programmer should
    know](http://www.eecs.berkeley.edu/~rcs/research/interactive_latency.html)
    and the [discussion on
    hackernews](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=4966363) (this is
    not the original source of the data, but a particularly good
    visualization of it nevertheless - see also [my extended
    version](https://hype-free.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/latency.html)
    which allows you to transform the numbers into whichever time-unit -
    s, ms, us - you need).
-   From the "Falsehoods programmers believe about X" department comes:
    -   [Falsehoods programmers believe about build
        systems](http://pozorvlak.livejournal.com/174763.html)
        (additionally to the comments on the post, also see [the
        discussion on
        Reddit](http://www.reddit.com/r/programming/comments/14eo9w/falsehoods_programmers_believe_about_build_systems/)
        and [a follow-up
        blogpost](http://www.evanjones.ca/build-java.html))
    -   [Falsehoods Programmers Believe About
        Names](http://www.kalzumeus.com/2010/06/17/falsehoods-programmers-believe-about-names/)

-   A video giving an overview of the different Google systems (search,
    map-reduce, GFS, etc). Nothing revolutionary, but a good first-time
    overview:
