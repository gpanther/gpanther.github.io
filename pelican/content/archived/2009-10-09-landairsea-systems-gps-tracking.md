GPS Tracking](http://www.landairsea.com) is a contentious issue, even
more when it is forced on the subject. There are however situations
where we can be legally obligated to subject ourselves to such tracking
(for example when we are using the car of the employer or if our legal
guardian wishes so). The LandAirSea company specializes in such tracking
systems. They provide a variety of models, some with real-time tracking
capabilities, others requiring the physical re-acquisition of the
equipment for later analysis. For example we have the [tracking
key](http://www.landairsea.com/gps-tracking-systems/gps-tracking-key.html)
(available also [on
Amazon](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000H9E9UG?ie=UTF8&tag=hypefree-20&linkCode=as2&camp=1789&creative=390957&creativeASIN=B000H9E9UG)
– disclosure: the link contains my affiliate ID), a very small
form-factor solution with mostly positive reviews.

The company has been around since 1994, so, as the old cliché says, they
must be doing something right. One positive aspect I observed is that
tracking seems to be free for many models, there are no additional
recurring costs besides the purchasing of the GPS. On the downside (if
this is a concern for you), the real-time tracking seems to be limited
to the mainland of USA. In conclusion: good company, nice offer and it
is worth considering if you are shopping around for such equipments. One
thing to keep in mind is that GPS units can be quite slow to acquire the
signal in my experience (up to a couple of minutes if it isn’t moving,
and even more if the unit is in motion).

only post positive facts).*
