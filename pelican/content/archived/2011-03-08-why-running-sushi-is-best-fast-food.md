I just realized that running sushi is the best fast-food *ever*. (Yes, I
have [strong opinions weakly
held](http://www.codinghorror.com/blog/2008/05/strong-opinions-weakly-held.html)):

-   You get you food in small chunks, so you can stop at any time and
    still don't feel like you've wasted food
-   You have a great variety of food and you can look at it before
    taking (rather than just looking at a picture in the menu and
    wondering how the real thing will look like)
-   It is most probably healthier than other kinds of fast-food
-   It is neither hot nor cold, so you can eat it right away (you don't
    have to wait for it to warm up or to cool down)
-   You don't have to order! The last thing you want to do when you are
    hungry is to stare at food and wait

PS. If you are Cluj (Romania) you can check out the [Wasabi Running
Sushi](http://www.wasabi-sushi.ro/). As far as I know they are the only
running sushi in Romania!
