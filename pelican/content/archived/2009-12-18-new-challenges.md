After missing [the announcement for the second part of the Network
Forensics Puzzle](http://forensicscontest.com/2009/10/10) (yes, I’m
subscribed the feed now!) I would like to regain your trust by bringing
two other contests to your attention:

-   [Miracle on Thirty-Hack
    Street](http://www.ethicalhacker.net/content/view/285/2/) from
    ethicalhacker.net
-   [the sevenfour challenges](http://argolith.ms/?p=sevenfour) (a
    “keygen-me” type of challenge)

Bonus content:

-   [t2’09 challenge
    solutions](http://www.t2.fi/2009/12/17/merry-xmas-and-happy-new-year/)
    (via the [Reverse Engineering
    Reddit](http://www.reddit.com/r/ReverseEngineering/comments/afvn4/t209_challenge_solutions_two_pdfs_by_author_and/))
-   [Hacking Challenges: Have Fun Improving Your Skills!
