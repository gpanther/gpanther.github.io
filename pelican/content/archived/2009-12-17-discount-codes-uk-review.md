These days most online shops offer the ability to use discount codes at
checkout and get a price reduction anywhere from 5% to 50%. These codes
are announced in various media (like podcast or blogs), but even if you
don’t follow the particular program, it is rather easy to find them with
a search engine.

Given these premises, sites like [Discoount
Codes](http://www.unbeatable.co.uk/news/discount-codes/) UK are welcome.
I didn’t use their services personally, but it is well organized with
direct links from the discount code to the store where you can use it
and good reputation on sites which track such things
([MyWOT](http://www.mywot.com/en/scorecard/www.unbeatable.co.uk),
[Norton
SafeWeb](http://safeweb.norton.com/report/show?url=www.unbeatable.co.uk&x=0&y=0)
and [SiteAdvisor](http://www.siteadvisor.com/sites/unbeatable.co.uk)).
For added safety I would recommend entering the addresses of the shops
manually, rather than using the provided links. So there you have it:
discount codes at your finger tips with the possibility to get a couple
of percents off. And even if some don’t work, you have nothing to loose
by trying to use them. Again a word of caution, especially around
holiday shopping: be cautious and either use big-brand shops (like
Amazon) or thoroughly check out the given shop (using a search engine
and searching for phrases like “[shopname] complaints”, “[shopname]
problems”, “[shopname] fraud”, etc). Better safe than sorry!
