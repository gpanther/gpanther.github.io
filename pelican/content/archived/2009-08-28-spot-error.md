C++ compilers are notorious for giving error messages which point you in
the wrong direction. However even simpler languages can have issues. Can
you spot the *real* problem with the java code below?

on the sidebar Eclipse shows two errors, one of which correctly
identifies the problem, but I still scratched by head for a few
