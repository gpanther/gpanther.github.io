There are many “web hosting review” sites out there and
alreadyhosting.com is one of them doing reviews for [Dedicated Server
Hosting](http://www.alreadyhosting.com/dedicated-server-hosting.php).
These sites usually get their revenue by using affiliate links in their
lists, and this particular one is no different. In general such lists
are a good starting point, but you should always be cautious when
choosing a hosting company this way.

What I would recommend when choosing a hosting company (or other
online-services company) to which you consider giving your money:

-   check if the company has accreditations from respectable review
    sources (if the company is based in the USA, look for the BSA for
    example). Always click trough to the review website and check the
    details, because some unscrupulous sites display the logos, even
    though they don’t have any actual accreditations
-   look up the domain name with [domaintools](http://domaintools.com/).
    See how long the domain has been registered (the longer, the
    better). See the address of the owner. If it is “privacy protected”,
    it should raise some red flags (while I admit that such services
    have value for individuals, I would be weary of doing business with
    companies unwilling to disclose their physical location.
-   Do a search for “company name scam”, “company name complaints” and
    other negative terms which come in mind. Do the same with their
    phone number. While you should be cautious in taking information
    found on the internet at face value, the prevalence of such articles
    should make you think twice.

While adhering to these rules will not entirely eliminate the
possibility of you being scammed, it should reduce it considerably. I
also try to pre-filter any site I write a review about using the above
methods.
