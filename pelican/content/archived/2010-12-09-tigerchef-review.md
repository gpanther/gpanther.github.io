Lately I've been experimenting with some simple cooking, and of course
for cooking you need [cooking
equipment](http://www.tigerchef.com/cooking-equipment.html). TigerChef
is one of the many sources of [cooking
equipment](http://www.tigerchef.com/cooking-equipment.html) you can get,
although they are oriented more at restaurants than individual needs.

Anyway, I'm quite happy with the initial experiments and with the help
of my dear wife who endures them and gives feedback on it I hope to
start making more and more complex dishes. It seems incredible how
simple it is to put together a dish following a recipe (but it is also
hard work). And you get a (hopefully) delicious reward at the end.

The two things I cooked so fare are potatoes cooked in their "skin" and
"turosgomboc" (Google translate is no help to me finding the
translations of these terms). The potatoes were the simpler of the two
(you just had to cook them in the oven for 40 minutes and eat it with
butter or cheese) while the "turosgomboc" was quite an involvement.
Fortunately I found [this
recipe](http://szekelyrecept.blogspot.com/2009/03/tehenturos-gomboc.html)
and it worked out great.
