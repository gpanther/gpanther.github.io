This is something new for me: [protein
shakes](http://www.strongernutrition.com/Products/Sports-Nutrition/Proteins/Protein-Shakes.aspx).
Medically I can't offer advice about it (I'm weary about using foreign
substances not recommended by a specialist), but the site certainly is
has some positive signs:

-   The badges at the bottom are clickable and they go to the respective
    sites which certify the site
-   The domain is registered since 2006 and they are paypal verified
    since 2007
-   They have an active Facebook and Twitter account
-   They use paypal / google checkout for payment which reduces your
    risk considerably

They also have also some less positive signs:

-   There is no physical contact address
-   The registration details are hidden by proxy registration
-   The phone-number is a generic one (I would have liked one which
    coincides with the physical location)

All in all I would recommend this site for small purchases from inside
the USA (they don't deliver internationally). Also, I would consult a
doctor (or multiple doctors) about the possible effect of the
substances. In my view (and I'm no doctor) this is more serious than the
homeopathic or "natural" substances and it should be handled with care.
Then again, I'm also against medicine / medical devices (like glasses)
being sold in places without expert supervision (like supermarkets).

*Full disclosure: this is a paid review from

understanding I was not obligated to skew my viewpoint in any way (ie.
only post positive facts).*
