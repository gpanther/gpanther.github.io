Many say that [local online marketing](http://www.epowerpackage.com/) is
the “next frontier”. While I have some doubts with regarding this
phenomenon (my money is on the ever expanding global economy – even
though I’ve got “slapped” a couple of times by companies refusing to
deliver to Romania), I’ve looked at [softline
local](http://www.epowerpackage.com/about/).

They seem like a company to consider if you wish to include such tool in
your arsenal. Their main target is the USA (understandably so, since
they are located in LA), so this probably *isn’t* for you if you are
outside of the USA or your services are not location dependent.

In case you do decide to go with them, I would recommend to check out in
detail their pricing and maybe inquire about the details of each element
in their price chart. While all of them seem like a good idea (I
especially liked the inclusion in GPS systems), I would question the
repeated value of some of them (maybe some of these services require an
annual fee – but many of them – like the inclusion in search indexes –
definitely don’t). In conclusion, my final advice is: the services look
promising, but proceed with caution, maybe do a short-term evaluation of
their services.

*Full disclosure: this is a paid review from

only post positive facts).*
