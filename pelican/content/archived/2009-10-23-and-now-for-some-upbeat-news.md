While I certainly like to
[rant](http://hype-free.blogspot.com/search/label/rant), one shouldn’t
forget about the more sunny side of life (unless you want to go
berserk). So here are some random positive things:

Some songs which I like:

A couple of great freeware programs for the Windows platform:

-   [CDBurnerXP](http://cdburnerxp.se/) – does everything Nero does, for
    free!
-   [DVD Flick](http://www.dvdflick.net/) – while from the technical
    standpoint it is “just a wrapper” over FFMpeg and similar tools, it
    does a great job – you can create your DVD in a couple of steps
-   [foobar2000](http://www.foobar2000.org/) – a great little MP3
    player, especially for those of us who liked the old Winamp, before
    it tried to do everything. At it can also do batch transcoding!
-   [IrfanView](http://www.irfanview.com/) – *the* free image viewer /
    converter!
-   [7-zip](http://www.7-zip.org/) – open source WinRar. Supports a lot
    of formats
-   [Far Manager Open
    Source](http://www.farmanager.com/download.php?l=en) – a great
    native win32 file manager with a retro look
-   [BB FlashBack
    Express](http://www.bbsoftware.co.uk/bbflashbackexpress/home.aspx) –
    a free screen capture software which works great
-   [VideoLan](http://www.videolan.org/) (or
    [VLC](http://www.videolan.org/) as it is better know) – the *simple*
    solution to play all your media, without having to install tones of
    codecs. If it would have a little better playlist management, I
    would use it as my primary media-player

A great quote: “the difference between communism and capitalism is that
in first men exploit other men, and in the second it is the other way
around”. Found it via [this New York Times
blog](http://freakonomics.blogs.nytimes.com/), written by the authors of
[Freakonomics](http://hype-free.blogspot.com/2009/08/freakonomics-review.html)
(and now the sequel
[](<a%20href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0060889578?ie=UTF8&tag=hypefree-20&linkCode=as2&camp=1789&creative=390957&creativeASIN=0060889578">)["\>'\>Superfreakonomics]("http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0060889578?ie=UTF8&tag=hypefree-20&linkCode=as2&camp=1789&creative=390957&creativeASIN=0060889578")).
It is a great blog, worth the read. Where elsewhere do you find [a
rigorous analysis of the logic in newspaper
comics](http://freakonomics.blogs.nytimes.com/2009/10/07/freakonomics-quiz-doonesbury-logic/)?

So there you have it, have a great day! An maybe listen to some [french
striptease
songs](http://vtopan.wordpress.com/2009/04/06/top-ten-striptease-songs/)
:-) (just a little SEO for a friend ;-))
