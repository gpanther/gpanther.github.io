AV-Comparatives is an independent, well-known and well respected testing
organization in the AV/Anti-Malware field. They recently published two
reports and one meta-report:

-   [Whole Product Dynamic
    Test](http://www.av-comparatives.org/comparativesreviews/dynamic-tests)
-   [Performance
    Test](http://www.av-comparatives.org/comparativesreviews/performance-tests)
-   [Summary
    Reports](http://www.av-comparatives.org/comparativesreviews/main-tests/summary-reports)

Go read them if you have questions like "which product is the best for
me?". Thank you Andreas for providing a great and impartial service.

PS. One surprising thing for me was the high detection rates in the
dynamic test - upward of 90%. This indicates that either I'm too much of
a cynic or that their crawler system still has room to improve - I would
expect AV products to be around 60-70% effective against new threats.
