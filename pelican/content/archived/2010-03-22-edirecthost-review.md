eDirectHost is one of the many companies which offer websites for people
who don’t want to get bogged down in technical details. The particular
niche eDirectHost focuses on is [ecommerce web
design](http://www.edirecthost.com/main/ecommerce). In particular, they
offer many features specific to such sites like: coupons, support for
different payment providers, etc. Two other positive aspects are that it
is BBB accredited (which should give you some confidence in the way they
conduct business) and their pricing is competitive with other solutions
like Yahoo! Store.

You are giving up some control when going with such solutions, no
question about it, so you should carefully evaluate the tradeoff. One
recommendation of mine would be to register the domain name separately
(ie. not trough them). This way you retain some amount of control and if
you have any problems with them, you can set up a site with an other
provider and redirect your domain there.

An other concern might be that they are billing you for services which
you could get otherwise for free (ie. website analytics, email, etc),
however they seem to be reasonable in this department also (the services
which you could get for free are included in all the packages).

Finally, you might wonder if the fact that the number of templates is
limited is a disadvantage. Most of the people however, when they are
shopping online, don’t mind it and are more concentrated on getting the
right product for the right price than how the site looks. The only time
looks influences their decision is when they estimate the credibility of
the site, and professionally designed templates certainly help there.
