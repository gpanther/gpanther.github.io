If you have Google Apps for Business, Google Video is still the
preferred method of storing videos "in the cloud": it is easier to embed
into Google Docs and probably more importantly - it can be truly private
(you can only access it if you are logged in with the correct account -
as opposed to YouTube where you can "hide" the video, but still anyone
with the link can access it).

To post a high quality video to Google Video you only have to do:

1.  Upload the video
2.  Wait

I kid you not :-). While initially the uploaded video is of poor
quality, apparently it gets processed in the background and later on (in
my experience: it takes around 30 minutes to process 1 hour of uploaded
video) a high quality version will be available.

HTH
