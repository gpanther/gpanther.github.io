After looking at the site of this [Medical
Alert](http://www.brickhousealert.com) company I’m left with troubling
questions in my mind. Having an ill grand-parent makes me acutely
appreciate the need for [Medical Alert](http://www.brickhousealert.com)
services, but this company leaves many open questions, especially
considering the fact that this is a company which requires a monthly
subscription. Their site is just a front for Yahoo Stores (which isn’t
bad in itself, since it makes business sense to outsource the non-core
competencies of your activity – like running a website) and the
registration data for the site is protected by “Whois Guard” (again,
something which makes sense in a lot of situations, but is just an other
stab in the trustworthiness of the company). They also don’t seem to
provide any physical address or concrete information about the personal
used in their call centers.

All in all, I wouldn’t do business with this company unless somebody I
know and trust recommends them. While the issues raised might very well
be just an oversight on the part of the company, it suggests a lack of
understanding of consumer psychology which is alarming given the
sensitive nature of the issue (health care).
