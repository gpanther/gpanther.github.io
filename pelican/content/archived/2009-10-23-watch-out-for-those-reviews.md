Recently I was buying a notebook HDD, and after considering a Samsung
SpinPoint model, I’ve looked around the net to see if there were any
known issues with the model. So I stumbled upon [this
page](http://datacent.com/datarecovery/hdd/samsung/SpinPoint+S) and my
blood ran cold. Quote:

Is this drive really of such poor quality? Does it really have all these
problems? But then I started looking around on their site at they seem
to have the same or very similar text for
[every](http://datacent.com/datarecovery/hdd/western_digital/WD1000BEVS)
[type](http://datacent.com/datarecovery/hdd/seagate/Barracuda+7200.7)
[of](http://datacent.com/datarecovery/hdd/fujitsu/MPB3043AT)
[HDD](http://datacent.com/datarecovery/hdd/maxtor/DiamondMax+2880)
[out](http://datacent.com/datarecovery/hdd/seagate/ST3300631AS)
[there](http://datacent.com/datarecovery/hdd/quantum/Fireball+TM). The
conclusion: they (Data Cent) are just trying to spam Google and I’m
inclined to believe that most of their advice isn’t founded on facts,
but rather on a randomized text generator. I for one encourage people
*not* to take their business to such a company.

PS. All the links to them are nofollow, so I’m not giving them any
Google love.
