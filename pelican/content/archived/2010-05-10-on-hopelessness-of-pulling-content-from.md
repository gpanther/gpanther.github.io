In the last couple of weeks I had at least two cases where I saw a
(provocative) post come up in my feedreader, click trough to read the
entire piece (BTW, partial feeds just suck!), just to find that the
owner removed the post. The first was from the DynDNS blog named “[Open
Dialogue](http://dyn.com/opendialogue)” (apparently openness and
censorship can co-exists in some people’s minds, without having their
brains blown-up by the cognitive dissonance) and it said the following:

The second one comes from the [MaraDNS
blog](http://maradns.blogspot.com/) (is there a pattern here? are there
many frustrated people in the DNS space? :-p):

It is my opinion that such actions inherently undermine the trust in a
person / brand. It is also ineffective (proven by the fact that at least
one person – ie. myself – was able to read the content). My ideal
publishing platform would be:

-   Versioned, so that everyone could look up what the text looked like
    at a given moment in time
-   Verified by a third-party agency (such as a timestamp signing
    service) which guarantees that it had a certain content at given
    point in time (you don’t have to transmit the full text to such a
    service BTW – them signing a cryptographic hash is good enough)
-   Digitally signed by the author

We all make mistakes. Lets act as grownups about it. Don’t try to wish
some things away. I understand that in some circumstances there are
legal obligations to take some things down, but at least post the
takedown reason in these cases (ie. “this post was taken down because of
allegedly defamatory content. sorry”).
