While most of the time I simply skip / delete any malicious content
encountered, from time to time I do some quick investigation on items
which peak my interest. For example the following comment was posted on
[a friends
blog](http://anti-virus-rants.blogspot.com/2010/01/whats-in-malware-name.html?showComment=1268851165907#c6369496536621245796):

I didn’t remove the links, since they point to complete benign sites
(sophos.com and kaspersky.com). [Mike’s
profile](http://www.blogger.com/profile/02458034558660798345) is
private, but a quick search shows
[many](http://ricedaddies.blogspot.com/2009/11/our-newest-edition.html#comment-6822895557266977511)

Unfortunately there doesn’t seem to be a way to report individual
Blogger users as spammers, just actual blogs.

BTW. the same comment spam seems to have hit [at least one other
security
blog](http://technicalinfodotnet.blogspot.com/2010/03/sophos-stop-spamming-me-and-end-your.html).
From the screenshot it seems that the spammer also uses the Blogger name
[MikeFrizzi](http://www.blogger.com/profile/13719854850902221999), which
seems to be linked to a real person, but then again, it is quite easy to
create realistically looking “shadow identities” for people by scraping
other websites.

This is as much as a quick search revealed and I would like to leave you
with the following thoughts:

-   Do comment moderation, at least retroactively if not proactively
    (small plug: I do moderate comments, but for the ones I approve the
    username links are without the nofollow tag – as per the [u comment,
    i follow](http://randaclay.com/blog/i-follow/) “ethos”)
-   There is very little certainty on the Internet. Just because someone
    claims to be somebody (like the MikeFrizzi profile), it doesn’t mean
    he actually is that person.
-   Also, the link between spam and the actual company being promoted is
    hard to prove. I don’t think that Sophos or Kaspersky were spamming
    here directly, but I do think it’s possible that some remotely
    connected company (ie. something along the lines of “a company hired
    by the outsourced marketing department”) did in fact employ such
    dubious (and useless, since in Blogger all the links in comments are
    “nofollow’ed”) techniques.
-   Or, it may be, that some blackhats want to give the impression that
    these companies are spamming to erode their credibility...

*Update*: [Sophos
confirmed](http://technicalinfodotnet.blogspot.com/2010/03/comment-spam-and-seo-campaign-apology.html)
that it was a run-amok "marketing" company hired by them who posted the
spam.
