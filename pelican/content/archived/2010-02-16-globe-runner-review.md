The second review for today is also for a [SEO
Consultant](http://globerunnerseo.com/): Globe Runner SEO. From all that
I can gather, they are a legitimate company ([here is their BBB
page](http://fortworth.bbb.org/codbrep.html?id=201030270) - so hard to
tell these days :-( ), and they also run [BabySafe
Travel](http://www.babysafetravel.com/). They also don’t seem to come up
in the first 10 pages (!) on Google when I’ve searched for SEO. Then
again, this might be a good thing, since these days many of the top
spots for any search are dominated by scammers (though not the top one
usually).

They also have an informative blog with original content. In the end it
everyone must make the decision about needing SEO help by herself /
himself. The technology is not very complicated behind most of the
actions and a good website should already have most of the elements, but
if you not a “webhead”, you will benefit from the advice of an expert.
One thing I missed on their site is the clear display of prices for
their services, but then again this can be interpreted in a positive
manner as: “we won’t go into an one-sided competition on price, because
we should be judged on more than one figure” (my words, not theirs :-)).

*Full disclosure: this is a paid review from
[ReviewMe](http://www.reviewme.com/). Under the terms of the
understanding I was not obligated to skew my viewpoint in any way (ie.
only post positive facts).*
