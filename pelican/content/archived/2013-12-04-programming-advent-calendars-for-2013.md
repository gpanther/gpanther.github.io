Programming advent calendars are posts/articles for a particular topic
posted daily between the 1st and 24th of December. They are modeled on
the advent calendars received by children on some countries which
contain 24 doors for the 24 days of advent and behind each door is a
piece of chocolate or other surprise which the child gets on the
particular day.

Here is the list of programming related advent calendars for 2013 (if
you know of more, leave a comment and I'll update the list):
