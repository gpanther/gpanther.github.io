As the readers of the blog know, [I've been slicing and dicing the
Twitter RSS feed for some
time](/2009/03/update-to-deshortify-pipe.html). Finally I launched a
free service which wraps all the improvements in one, easy to use and
best of all, free (!) service: [The Twit
Feeder](http://www.thetwitfeeder.com/).

blog](http://blog.thetwitfeeder.com/2010/01/launching-twit-feeder.html):

> Efficiency is key for anyone consuming large amount of information.
> One of the keys to efficiency is to centralize your information
> consumption as much as possible. This is the reason why I chose to
> subscribe to the RSS feeds of the Twitter accounts I liked, instead of
> using the built-in follow mechanism: because I already use Google
> Reader and it is much less cumbersome to add an other feed into it,
> than to add an other site to my daily routine.
>
> The Twitter RSS is a little lacking in features (understandably so,
> since it isn't their main focus), so I've created a service which
> "enriches" the plain RSS feed:
>
> -   @links and \#hashtags are made clickable
>     ([example](http://www.thetwitfeeder.com/html/twitter.com/bagder))
> -   short URLs are expanded
>     ([example](http://www.thetwitfeeder.com/html/twitter.com/bagder))
> -   the avatar of the author is shown
>     ([example](http://www.thetwitfeeder.com/html/twitter.com/bagder))
> -   smileys are transformed into their pictorial representation
> -   it is possible to subscribe for hashtag feeds, not just individual
>     users
>     ([example](http://www.thetwitfeeder.com/html/twitter.com/%23twitter))
> -   geo-tagged status updates contain a link to the map showing the
>     location
>     ([example](http://www.thetwitfeeder.com/html/identi.ca/evan))
>
> So there you have it. Use it, enjoy it, [support
> it](http://www.thetwitfeeder.com/supportus).
>
> PS. What should the next feature added be? I can think of two:
>
> -   [Create a
>     badge](http://code.google.com/p/twitfeeder/issues/detail?id=1)
>     (which can be embedded on third-party websites) showing the
>     follower count and the subscriber count trough Twit Feeder
> -   [Make it possible to embed a HTML version of the feed on third
>     party
>     websites](http://code.google.com/p/twitfeeder/issues/detail?id=2)
>     (like blogs)
>
> Do you like these features? Vote for them by starring them. Have other
> ideas? Add it to [our issue
> tracker](http://code.google.com/p/twitfeeder/issues/list). Also,
> bribes are welcome and they speed up the implementation of a feature
> considerably ;-)
