This post is a response to [a blogpost on tudor g’s blog about software
piracy issues in
Romania](http://studentclub.ro/tudorg/archive/2009/09/30/despre-pirateria-software.aspx),
and as such it might not be of interest to you, dear international
reader. If this is the case, feel free to skip this post.

Disclaimer: arguments are very emotional things. As much as we would
like to think that they consists of logical statements and counter
statements with the “best” arguments winning, in real life the
acceptance or rejection of a given argument very much depends on the
frame of reference of individual persons. With this in mind, I believe
that [Tudor](http://studentclub.ro/tudorg/) and me have very different
frames of reference (him being a Microsoft employee and me being an
open-source enthusiast) and as such I’m quite sure that nothing written
by me here will change his mind (and conversely, nothing written by him
will change my mind). Still, I think that this is a useful exercise to
get things off my chest and to document arguments for more open-minded
people :-)

1.  His first argument is that installing and using pirated software is
    harder that legitimate software because mechanisms like WGA - I
    don’t think that this argument holds water, since most people (the
    “average user”) can’t install an OS, regardless if it is pirated or
    legitimate. Just ask yourself the following question: how many of
    the non-technical people you know installed themselves the OS on
    their computer? I would bet you that the number is very, very close
    to 0.

    If the OS is installed by the “neighbor kid from the 2nd floor”,
    then this argument doesn’t hold. Even more, many geeks pride
    themselves with being able to perform complicated tasks, like
    disabling the WGA, and as such, for them the existence of protection
    element is a positive thing (a challenge to be solved).

    Finally, the inverse of the argument (that legitimate MS software is
    easier to use than pirated one) isn’t true either in my experience.
    I had numerous occasions where (completely legitimate, bought with
    the computer OEM) Windows failed to validate, a (again, completely
    legit, boxed version) Win 2k3 SBS suddenly refused to work because
    it needed to be a DC (and it told me after 3 months!), the Windows 7
    beta deactivated itself periodically, VM’s deactivated themselves
    after moving from one machine to the other for purely technical
    reasons (even though the one-machine / one-owner / one-copy rule was
    always observed), etc.

2.  The second argument is that there is no peer-pressure to pirate in
    Romania (that not “everybody is doing it”) – I would suggest him to
    visit *any* campus in Romania and check out the (pirated) software
    which can be found on the network. And not only that, but music,
    movies, books, etc. Or to go to repair shops and ask for MS Windows
    / MS Office being preinstalled on the computer – the answer will
    almost always be positive. Even more, the next generation feels
    entitled to these freebies (and it isn’t something specific to
    Romania either, thanks to the abundance of the [freemium business
    model](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Freemium) on the Internet).

    In the long term (IMHO) less and less people will be willing to pay
    for things which they perceive as basic needs. The only options for
    old-style software companies (like Microsoft) are to include more
    and more technical measures to try to prevent this (even though the
    current measures already make MS Windows annoying to use) or to
    raise the level of punishment associated with piracy (which
    shouldn’t be possible in democratic countries because of public
    backlash)

3.  Piracy doesn’t help the software companies by making their product
    more well known – if this would to be true, why do you think that
    there are associations in people’s mind like Microsoft – Windows,
    Office – Microsoft, image editing – Photoshop, CD burning – Nero and
    so on? Most people use whatever is already installed on the computer
    to accomplish their jobs. This is why OEMs get big bucks from
    software companies to preinstall their product.

    I don't buy the “starving programmer” argument either. The cost of
    copying software is minuscule. Which means that over 80% (this is of
    course a number pulled out of my rear, but I’m quite sure that the
    real number is somewhere in the ballpark) of each sale is pure
    profit. Which means that (a) a [freemium type
    model](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Freemium) can easily be
    sustained and (b) that even a few sales mean that the company makes
    a nice profit, and excessive focus on this part (ie. “we are loosing
    X billion of USD to piracy” – which BTW is not true for at least two
    reasons – first because the method to determine the number of
    pirated copies is questionable and second, because it assumes that
    every person who “pirates” would buy the product if s/he didn’t have
    access to the pirated version) is pure greed – which, let us
    remember, is one of the seven deadly sins.

    Also, as a programmer, you don’t have to write commodity software.
    Let me tell you, there is very good money to be made from writing
    custom software for a small number of clients.

    A final point I would like to make with regards the relation of
    piracy to innovation: remember that all three “big” powers (USA,
    Russia and China) started out (and some are still) by rejecting
    patents to bootstrap their industry. Something worth thinking
    about...

4.  That people buy because somehow they are convinced that it is “the
    right thing”, not because of fear – I’m not seeing it. At least at
    the individual level I don’t know *anybody* who bought a single
    Microsoft product (including myself, I’m living off my MSDN AA
    licenses). At a company level the motivation (arguably) is mostly
    fear. They buy licenses for the same reason they pay taxes. Also (as
    I’ve already said at point 2), the willingness of people will only
    go down, not up.

5.  Software is not overpriced, especially when considering the income
    level of Romanians – this is IMHO the best example for the “pink
    sunglasses” Tudor is wearing and how his frame of reference distorts
    his perception. The average (net) income per month in Romania for
    2008 was somewhere around 400 USD (this would mean 4800 USD per year
    for those of you who use this frame of reference). Given this
    figure, is it reasonable to expect that people give more than half
    of their monthly income (or even all it, if we consider that a
    computer would need MS Windows + MS Office + AV) for software? May I
    venture a guess that (a) Tudor has at least five time the average
    net income and (b) he has free access to all of Microsoft’s
    software, and as such, he might not see the real situation? My
    challenge to Tudor would be: how much of the software he has right
    now on his personal machine did he pay for?

My conclusion is that software piracy is here to stay. Especially in
more poor countries like ours. To give Microsoft what is due: they do
really excellent software (not that they don’t do mistakes, like Vista –
which is abysmal – I’m speaking from a first hand experience, having
played with it on two “Vista certified” laptops and in VMs). Even so,
their expectation is unrealistic at a minimum and even unethical. Also,
as a developer, if you develop using a technology (OS, libraries,
components, etc) for which you don’t have the source code, you will hit
“undebuggable” issues sooner or later.

PS. Vista is the new ME – just worse:
