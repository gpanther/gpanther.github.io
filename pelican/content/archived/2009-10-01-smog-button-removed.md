Almost a year ago [I added a SMOG button to each
blogpost](http://hype-free.blogspot.com/2008/12/everything-old-is-new-again-smog.html),
which (in a more or less serious manner) evaluated the “reading level”
needed to understand the blogpost. However, today the site used for this
service came up with a warning from Google saying that it might be
malicious. I’ve looked into it, and indeed, it contains an IFRAME
pointing towards a malicious site.

So I’ve taken down the script until this issue is resolved to protect
people. Hopefully this issue will quickly be resolved.
