As they say: just because you're paranoid, it doesn't mean that you're
not being watched! Here are a couple of links which freaked me out
recently:

-   [Warily, and with much
    trepidation](http://infotrope.net/blog/2009/11/09/warily-and-with-much-trepidation/) -
    a blogpost about how one deleted his facebook settings because of
    privacy concerns. I do have a facebook page, but I only use to
    prevent "identity spoofing" and have almost zero interest in
    actually using it. Also, on a related note, I've read recently that
    someone was asked a security question by his bank which would
    indicate that they (whoever "they" might be - the bank, a third
    party contracted to do it, an information broker, etc) are
    data-mining facebook (the question was something along the lines of
    "your sister-in-law's maiden name" - which BTW I couldn't answer!)
-   [How to Generate Nice Graphs for
    Feedburner](http://www.catonmat.net/blog/generating-feedburner-graphs/) -
    nice article about generating graphs (quite nice looking graphs I
    might add!) with Perl, until you realize that your feedburner
    statistics is freely available for everyone, just by fetching one
    URL which has no protection whatsoever! Not that I consider
    feedburner stats "extremely sensitive", but it makes you wonder what
    other data do "helpful" service providers make available about your
    activities without your knowledge?
-   How to take down a blogspot blog (like mine for example!)? Just [get
    Google to suspend the associated gmail
    account](http://globaleconomicanalysis.blogspot.com/2009/12/spoof-attack-takes-down-blog.html)!
    Now, from the writeup it is not entirely clear what happened.
    Scenario A: someone broke into Mish's account (by bruteforcing the
    password / guessing the password reset question / installing a
    keylogger on his machine / etc) and used it to send spam. Scenario
    B: someone sent spam spoofing the "from" address (quite easy to do,
    but most spam filters should detect it). If it was scenario A, we
    can at least console ourselves with the fact that there is something
    we can do (like practicing "safe-hex"). If it was scenario B, it
    means that any two-bit script kiddie can take down any blog... And
    not every one of us knows Googlers like Mish who can help him sort
    the situation out quickly.

Now, if you're still reading and not hiding under a rock scared, here
are some links to cheer you up:
