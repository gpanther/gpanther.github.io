I won’t go as far as to say that the calendar system is arbitrary and
there is no reason to follow it :-p, but I have to say that giving
donations shouldn’t be limited to Christmas. So if are/get in a giving
mood, here are some geeky organizations you could donate to:

-   There is [an auction going on on
    eBay](http://cgi.ebay.com/ws/eBayISAPI.dll?ViewItem&item=190362159759#ht_500wt_1182)
    for a very rare userfriendly.org T-shirt. All the proceedings [will
    be donated to cancer
    research](http://ars.userfriendly.org/news/?id=1262528117) (there is
    1 day and 8 hours remaining as of this moment)
-   Buy [Bad Code Offsets](http://codeoffsets.com/Buy.aspx). 100% of the
    money will be donated to open source projects
-   Most of the “free” services on the Internet accept donations: go
    donate to your favorite open-source project / podcast.

When we share, we all get richer. (ok, this is not mathematically exact,
but it sure sounds nice, doesn’t it?)

*Update*: here are a couple more projects/organizations you should
consider donating to:

-   The [EFF](http://www.eff.org/) - Electronic Frontier Foundation:
    "the leading civil liberties group defending your rights in the
    digital world."
-   The [SFLC](http://www.softwarefreedom.org/) - The Software Freedom
    Law Center: "We provide legal representation and other law-related
    services to protect and advance Free, Libre and Open Source Software
    (FLOSS)". Also, you should check out [their
    podcast](http://www.softwarefreedom.org/podcast/) which is always
    full with interesting information.
-   [Wikileaks](http://www.wikileaks.org/): "The Sunshine Press
    (WikiLeaks) is an non-profit organization funded by human rights
    campaigners, investigative journalists, technologists and the
    general public. Through your support we have exposed significant
    injustice around the world—successfully fighting off over 100 legal
    attacks in the process."
-   [OpenStreetMap](http://www.openstreetmap.org/): "The Free Wiki World
    Map" AKA the community created and owned map of the entire world.
