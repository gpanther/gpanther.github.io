After asking you [if you use
Perl](http://hype-free.blogspot.com/2009/10/if-you-use-perl.html), now
Iâ€™m asking you to help build the [Mozilla Developer
Network](http://hacks.mozilla.org/2009/10/mozilla-developer-network/)
(MDC). They are running [a
survey](http://pro22.sgizmo.com/survey.php?SURVEY=JHS55VFMB9690AI0QL6UQ6IS65WVMK-190379-49226259&pswsgt=1256662160&sg_r=http%3A%2F%2Fhacks.mozilla.org%2F2009%2F10%2Fmozilla-developer-network%2F&sg_g=f508212776c9f2d82998cc2838ae7ef9&_csg=346l68Yu1AI5o&notice=DO-NOT-DISTRIBUTE-THIS-LINK)
to get to know their audience better. Please take it if you use the MDC
and have a couple of minutes of free time.

PS. You can read some preliminary results from the Perl IDE poll
[here](http://szabgab.com/blog/2009/10/1256593212.html).
