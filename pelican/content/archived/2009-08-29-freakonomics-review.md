I know, I know, I'm quite late to the game
([Freakonomics](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0060731338?ie=UTF8&tag=hypefree-20&linkCode=as2&camp=1789&creative=9325&creativeASIN=0060731338)
was first published in 2005), but I still feel that this book deserves a
review.

What I like about it the most, is the fact that it tries to teach
critical thinking, a thing which is lacking these days. The book
provides vivid and easy to read descriptions of investigative stories,
similar to detective/murder-mystery books, about how seemingly distant
events relate to one-another. Each chapter stands on its own and can be
read-trough in a short amount of time. Where necessary, the book
provides high-level description of the statistical terms (like
regression-analysis), without giving the impression of "talking down".

My favorite quote from the book is actually not from the book authors,
but non-the-less I find it very fitting (and I'm sure that the authors
agree with me, since they included it in the book :-)):

> "We Associate truth with convenience," he wrote, "with what closely
> accords with self-interest and personal well-being or promises best to
> avoid awkward effort or unwelcome dislocation of life. We also find
> highly acceptable what contributes the most to self-esteem." Economic
> and social behaviors, Galbraith continued, "are complex, and to
> comprehend their character is mentally tiring. Therefore we adhere, as
> though to a raft, to those ideas which represent our understanding."

I consider this book one worth reading. The only negative was that I got
the "extended" version (which is *not* the one I link to) and I found
that the "extension" was just some rehashing of the content from the
book and from [their blog](http://freakonomics.blogs.nytimes.com/). So
get the real thing.

PS. [Wikipedia
says](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Freakonomics#Planned_sequel) (so it
must be true :-p) that a sequel is coming. I'm looking forward to it!
Even if it will be half of the quality of the original (as sequels
usually are), it should still be a great read!
