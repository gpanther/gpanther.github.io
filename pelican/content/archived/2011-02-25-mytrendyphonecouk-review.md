My assignment - which I choose to accept :-) - was to review a [mobile
accessories](http://www.mytrendyphone.co.uk/shop/mobile-accessories-categories-2418s.html)
site, namely mytrendyphone.co.uk. All the signs for this site check out:

-   It was [registered a couple of years
    ago](http://whois.domaintools.com/mytrendyphone.co.uk) and didn't
    move around much
-   It has several real seals (real meaning that they are linked to the
    originating site, where you can check out the referring site is
    really approved, didn't just faked the seal)
-   Their contact address checks out (based on Google maps) as does
    their phone number (which is in the London area)
-   I found a couple of complaints about them [on this
    site](http://www.trustpilot.co.uk/review/www.mytrendyphone.co.uk),
    however they seem to be very responsive to the negative complaints

After doing the basic safety research I went on to browse the site and I
found many interesting items, for example [this Jabra
headset](http://www.mytrendyphone.co.uk/shop/jabra-bt3030-bluetooth-8008p.html).
What I like about about these models of headsets is the fact that they
use standard minijack for headphones, which means that they can easily
be replaced in case they stop working (and it is my experience that
headphones are the first to go bad).

An other category which I found interesting was [the tools
section](http://www.mytrendyphone.co.uk/shop/tools-111s.html). While
some of the tools are clearly overpriced, the more complex kits look
interesting and I am tempted to buy something from there.

*Full disclosure: this is a paid review from

understanding I was not obligated to skew my viewpoint in any way (ie.
only post positive facts).*
