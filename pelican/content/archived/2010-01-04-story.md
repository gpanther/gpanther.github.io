*If you are not familiar with the “Bob story” concept: I first heard
about it on the [Pauldotcom](http://pauldotcom.com/) podcast, where
Twitchy used to tell stories about how “Bob” went wardriving, created a
fake AP and did other grayhat things. They may have taken the idea from
somewhere, but this is where I’ve heard it first.*

Before Christmas Bob decided to treat himself with a Wii Fit (yes, the
only thing which came of it was a machine telling him that he is fat –
don’t ask :-p). Looking around several places he finally decided to go
with a supermarket, since it was the cheapest choice (by about 30 EUR).
He picked it up and rushed trough checkout. After paying he realized
that the [anti-theft](http://www.dragon-guard.com/boxguardalarm.html)
system wasn’t removed, but since it didn’t beep when exiting the store
he figured that it should be ok.

So he rushes home and cuts one of the wires (sidenote: with very
low-tech equipment it took less than two minutes to do that. Using
something professional, yet still discreet enough to fit in a pocket, it
would take less than 30 seconds). And behold: it started to beep. The
beep was somewhat loud, but not so loud as to be heard outside of an
apartment, especially when put in some kind of acoustic insulation. Most
probably it would attract attention in a supermarket though. And thus
the alarm system met ~~its maker~~ a hammer and was promptly silenced.
Just for the fun of it, Bob decided to take it completely apart to see
how it worked:

Ideas / lessons / thoughts:

-   The construction is not that robust and would quickly give way if a
    determined / knowledgeable attacker was picking away at it (physical
    force is optional)
-   It is powered by four small batteries. In fact, it is very easy to
    deactivate by using Philips a screwdriver and removing the
    batteries. In what Bob can only assume to be standard operating
    procedure, the battery access was oriented towards the box and
    became accessible only after the unit was removed from the box
-   It would be interesting to try the following experiment, cut the
    insulation in two places on one of the wires. Link together the two
    cuts with a good conductor (like a copper wire). Now cut it in the
    middle. If the system isn’t watching for fluctuations in the
    resistance, just for contact / no contact it should work (which is
    probably the case, since the alarm didn’t trigger until Bob fully
    cut trough the cable, even though he partially cut it before)
-   There are actually two pair of wires crossed rather than one long
    wire. The “normal” deactivation mechanism is probably a magnet which
    allows the case to be turned counter-clockwise (this is normally
    blocked by the combination of metallic plate (upper side of the
    picture) and the white ring (which was “teeth” oriented in one
    direction). Crafting a small deactivation device seems also rather
    easy.

My conclusion is that (similar to infosec) “you don’t have to outrun the
bear, only your friend” – meaning that you only have to raise the bar a
little to eliminate most of the problems. Then again, one should go into
such endeavors with “eyes open” and knowing the limitation of the
technology (which very few vendors will tell you). And, as always, it
will annoy your customers!
