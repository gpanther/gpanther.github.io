Well, new for me at least...

The first one is [0x41414141.com](http://0x41414141.com/). Just go to
the site and you can start directly. As far as I know, this is not
time-bound.

The second one is [spargecoduasta.com](http://www.spargecoduasta.com/)
(“break this code”). It is put up by BitDefender and I don’t know if it
has a time limit. The levels I’ve seen seem to focus on C/C++. It is
available in both Romanian and English.

Finally, a little off-topic, but still a challenge: [The Science
Knowledge Quiz](http://pewresearch.org/sciencequiz/) – with the tagline
“Are you more science-savvy than the average American?”. Via [Pat’s
Daily Grind](http://padraic2112.wordpress.com/2009/09/22/only-10/) (I’ve
got 11 out of the 12).

Have fun!
