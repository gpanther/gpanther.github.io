Some time ago I [ranted about cognitive quantum
leaps](http://hype-free.blogspot.com/2009/08/myth-of-cognitive-quantum-jumps.html).
Below is a presentation given at Google by Scott Berkun about the same
topic. While the talk itself is two years old, the examples are still
very relevant, and he presents it very eloquently. Enjoy!
