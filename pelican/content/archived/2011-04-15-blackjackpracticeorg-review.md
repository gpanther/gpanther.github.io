I was hired to write a review about blackjackpractice.org which
purportedly [blackjack practice](http://blackjackpractice.org/), however
I wasn't able to verify this, since the site is down (currently it is
showing a default directory listing from Apache, earlier today it was
showing an empty page). There is very little know about this by the
[usual](http://whois.domaintools.com/blackjackpractice.org)
[sources](http://www.mywot.com/en/scorecard/blackjackpractice.org), and
there doesn't seem to be anything interesting on the same server (it is
hard to tell if the same person owns all the domain on the server due to
the "privacy protected" registration).

Now back to the idea to blackjack practice: can you really train
yourself? Probably, to some extent (hey, even Kent Beck - yes, that Kent
Back - has [a poker training
website](http://pokerworkout.appspot.com/)). With regular exercise you
can memorize [basic strategy
table](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blackjack#Basic_strategy) (this will
help you with any game, regardless if its with a live dealer or with a
machine - supposing that the machine is playing fair) and then you can
move to more advanced techniques like card counting or shuffle tracking.
I doubt however that you can achieve a level where this would be a
profitable endeavor.

any way (ie. only post positive facts).*
