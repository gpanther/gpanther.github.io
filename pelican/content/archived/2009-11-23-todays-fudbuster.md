We begin today’s FUD-buster with – applause please – cyberterorism via
an “article”: [Cyberterrorism: A look into the
future](http://www.infosecurity-magazine.com/view/5217/cyberterrorism-a-look-into-the-future/).
The article talks about Estonia (which is the poster-child for “cyber”
incidents these days) and says the following thing (amongst others
equally high-quality content) – emphasis added:

> “The three-week cyberattack on Estonia threatened to black out the
> country's digital infrastructure, *infiltrating the websites of the
> nation’s banks and political institutions”*

The article cites as source (hey, at least they cite sources) an equally
[“well researched” piece from the
Telegraph.co.uk](http://www.telegraph.co.uk/comment/personal-view/3640255/Cyber-terrorism-is-real---ask-Estonia.html)
which says almost the same thing. Now I seem to remember that the
Estonia incident was just a large scale DDoS attack, so I’ve looked
around for more reliable sources, like this article on Dark Reading
[Authoritatively, Who Was Behind The Estonian
Attacks?](http://www.darkreading.com/blog/archives/2009/03/authoritatively.html?cid=ref-true)
by [Gadi Evron](http://www.lifeboat.com/ex/bios.gadi.evron) (or see
[this other
article](http://docs.google.com/gview?a=v&q=cache:byUMj6Djlb8J:www.ciaonet.org/journals/gjia/v9i1/0000699.pdf+gadi+evron+estonia+cert&hl=en&pid=bl&srcid=ADGEESh8wErGTDd40wtemXK4abbPY9bDAvS3H8CjDInhuu6a1FmG7mbL00j8MksD5sE6tEaNDaUHKEnTbWaVHNFxGW7xZMvBmdNJAvkQrQXxumlS_6pwleWZkauM566sE2C_0vEQwQ2R&sig=AFQjCNFc48jxFw9j87PpP5lSFb91RF2KIA)).
This confirms what I was remembering: it was a large scale DDoS attack
with some minor defacements, but in no way were they “infiltrating the
websites”.

The second (unrelated, other than the fact that it is an overstatement)
quote comes from [the Kaspersky
blog](http://www.viruslist.com/en/weblog?weblogid=208187902), where we
can read that:

> “a vast amount of pirate software nowadays contains trojans, both for
> the PC and Mac”

This depends very much on your interpretation of “vast amount” (as me
how I know :-P). Of the actual pirated software shared in limited
networks like college campuses, very little is infected. What are
extremely likely to be malicious are the crack / keygen websites. Either
they contain exploits directly or they bundle malware with the
downloads. An other sneaky way, seen on P2P networks like Gnutella or
eDonkey, is to run bots which respond to any search with an executable
that contains the keywords in the name and is – of course – malicious.
So, depending on your interpretation of “vast amount”, this doesn’t hold
up.

The conclusion, as always: do your own research!
