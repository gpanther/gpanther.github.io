The short answer is: I don't know :-)

While I was watching National Geographic, I caught a glimpse of the BMW
"Efficient Dynamic" advertisement campaign. The claims made by this
campaign were quite extraordinary and - being the cynic that I am - I
thought: hang on, this sounds too good to be true. The claims as I
recall were:

-   BMW reduced fuel consumption by 16%
-   This reduction is more than twice the reduction achieved by the next
    premium segment competitor
-   This reduction is more than twice the average reduction obtained by
    the industry

Being an aspiring skeptic I decided to look into these claims, but being
the lazy ass that I am, quickly gave up after making a mental list of
what would be involved (finding out what they mean by "premium segment"
and who their competitor were, finding a reliable source of data, etc).
So, instead, I turned to math to see if all these claims can be true at
once. So, in math-talk we have the following data:

-   BMW = 16
-   Lets suppose that we have three competitors A, B and C with A being
    the closes to BMW
-   A, B and C are in the interval [0, 100]
-   BMW \>= 2\*A
-   BMW \>= 2 \* AVG(BMW, A, B, C)

Then I turned to the [OpenOffice
Solver](http://wiki.services.openoffice.org/wiki/Documentation/OOo3_User_Guides/Calc_Guide/Solver)
which promptly came up with an answer: A=8, B=0, C=0. Starting from this
I came up with a more plausible-looking solution: A=7, B=5, C=5.

What does this mean? That - mathematically speaking - the claims made
might be true. As always - trust, but verify. These simple mathematical
tools are available to everyone and can be used to unmask the more
extreme false claims (of course, just because a claim is mathematically
possible, it doesn't make it necessarily true). Go search for
information. You should find it - since it wants to be free!
