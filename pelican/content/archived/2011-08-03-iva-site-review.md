Reviewing this site pose a conundrum to me (other than how to write the
word conundrum): on the one side they seem to be a legitimate site for
[IVA advice](http://www.bainesandernst.co.uk/iva/), with a long standing
domain registration, a physical address and even an entry at the Office
of Fair trading (which seem to be the equivalent of the Better Business
Bureau). On the other hand there are other sites with the same profile -
debt relief - which refer the same physical address but are hosted
elsewhere (in Germany for example).

I can't draw a definite conclusion about this. I'm not from the UK and
have zero familiarity with the UK law. Probably the only advice I can
give at this moment is to try asking your close family or your trusted
friends. I imagine that it is painful to do so, but this is the only
source I can think of where you can get money without the exorbitant
rates asked by payday lenders. All that I can do is hope that you
prevail, since I have a deep belief that as long as you have
determination, you will find your place.

*Full disclosure: this is a paid review from
[ReviewMe](http://www.reviewme.com/). Under the terms of the
understanding I was not obligated to skew my viewpoint in any way (ie.
only post positive facts).*
