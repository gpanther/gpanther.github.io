There isn't much I can say about this company. They seem very legitimate
by all indications (domain name registered more than 10 years ago, with
the physical address of the company, no complaints on the web, etc).
Their goal seems also very laudable: creating [playground
surfacing](http://www.rubberecycle.com/playground_rubber_mulch.asp) out
of recycled tire rubber. While I don’t have enough information to
ascertain if this is truly more eco-friendly than getting rid of the
tires in other ways (burning them for example – there are many factors
here – the recycling process itself might consume a larger amount of
energy – see a similar issue with the fact that placing solar panels in
the Sahara desert might actually *increase* global warming), reusing is
always a laudable goal.

The company is also relatively media-savvy: they have a (Facebook) like
button on their website, they have [a
blog](http://blog.rubberecycle.com/) and their site is relatively nice
looking (even more important: it doesn’t look like one of the stock
templates from designers). The only thing you can’t do is to order
online, but probably it’s better this way, since we are talking about
relatively large amount of material (and automatically large amount of
money) so a personal contact is a better option. Also, I didn’t see any
indication that they ship outside of the USA, probably for the same
reason.

Thumbs up for a small-medium business which has a good product!
