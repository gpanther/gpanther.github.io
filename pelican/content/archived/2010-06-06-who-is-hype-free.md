I’ve done [a writeup about the name of
blog](http://hype-free.blogspot.com/2006/09/print-hello-world.html) when
I started it. However recently two links came up in my Google Alerts:

The [first
one](http://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=Hype%20Free) is from
Urban Dictionary and it defines hype free as “Slang word for drug free”.

The [second
one](http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index?qid=20100601161548AAmEFtl)
is from Yahoo! Answers and states pretty much the same thing (in a
conversational form).

I didn’t know this meaning of the expression until these items came on
my radar recently, but they are very funny (and certainly true in more
than one sense).

*Update*: the Yahoo Answers page states that it was deleted “according
to our Community Guidelines”. Bummer.
