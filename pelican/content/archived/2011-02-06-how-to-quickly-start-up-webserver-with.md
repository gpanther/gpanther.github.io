Sometimes you need to quickly start up a webserver that serves up static
files (I will describe such a case in the next post). Python to the
rescue (works on both Linux and Windows if you have Python installed):

For Python 2.x (this is what most sites show you):

`python -m SimpleHTTPServer 9914`

For Python 3.x (thanks to [this
comment](http://linux.byexamples.com/archives/506/python-simple-http-server-for-file-sharing/#comment-99256)):

`python -m http.server 9914`

These will start up a webserver on port 9914, and you can access it via
the address <http://localhost:9914>. Warning! The webserver will be
available to anyone who can connect to your computer directly (unless
there are other mechanisms to restrict it â€“ like firewalls or NAT), so
use your judgment!
