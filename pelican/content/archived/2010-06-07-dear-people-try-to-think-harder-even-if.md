This again is the case of a couple of links on the same topic piling up
in my reader (this tends to happen if you take a pause in blogging :-)):

-   [Gmail's Spam Filter No Longer
    Effective?](http://googlesystem.blogspot.com/2010/05/gmails-spam-filter-no-longer-effective.html)
-   [60% of Facebook users consider quitting over
    privacy](http://www.sophos.com/blogs/gc/g/2010/05/19/60-facebook-users-quitting-privacy/)
-   [Poll: 93% say Facebook should make you 'opt-in' to sharing rather
    than
    'opt-out'](http://www.sophos.com/blogs/gc/g/2010/05/27/poll-93-facebook-optin-sharing-optout/)
-   [Marketing study: avid gamers average seven hours per

The commonality between all these articles is that they make statements
based on faulty questions ([PHD Comics says it
best](http://hype-free.blogspot.com/2010/01/you-go-phd-comics.html)). A
website poll is not the same as a scientific study (to name justÂ  one
the problems - it has a selection bias towards the reader of the
particular site - which wouldn't be a problem if the results wouldn't be
presented as applicable for the general population). And even if they
were scientific studies, the purpose of a scientific study isn't to find
the absolute truth! It is to present a hypothesis which doesn't
contradict any of the current observation. But it doesn't exclude the
possibility that in the future there will be an observation which
contradicts the hypothesis, and as such, it must be changed.
