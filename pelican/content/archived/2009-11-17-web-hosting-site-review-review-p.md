WebHostingChoice pretends to be a hosting review site (it contains
categories like “[best uk web
hosting](http://www.webhostingchoice.com/directory/uk/)”), however it
only seems to be a placeholder for a couple of affiliate links to a
limited number of hosts. Their [WOT (web of trusts)
rating](http://www.mywot.com/en/scorecard/www.webhostingchoice.com)
isn’t so great either. While WOT has its limits (mainly because of its
“crowdsourced” nature), when it has several negative ratings, it can be
a good indicator that there are problems with the given site.

So how to find a good webhost? First of all, you should realize that
(usually) you get what you pay for (ie. “free” webhosts are rarely
free). I would recommend going with a “big brand” company like
[GoDaddy](https://www.godaddy.com/) or
[Rackspace](http://www.rackspace.com/index.php). You can fairly easily
find coupon codes for them (just listen to some technical podcasts)
which can get you a considerable percentage (like 20%) off. An other
company which seems very good is [firehost](http://www.firehost.com/).
While they are a little pricy (especially compared to the other two
companies), they consider security an explicit priority, which is very
important these days IMHO – if they are willing to [take on people with
large targets on their back like Kevin
Mitnick](http://news.cnet.com/8301-27080_3-10299126-245.html), they
should be able to protect your business too.
