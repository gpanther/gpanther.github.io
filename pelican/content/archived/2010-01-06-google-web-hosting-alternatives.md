Google is one of the “big three” integrated web hubs on the internet
offering many services in one place, most of them free. Of course
everything has it price (nothing is truly free) and these offerings
being free means that they don’t guarantee a very end-user friendly SLA.
For example they recently retired Google Pages and now offer Google
Sites. While the services are similar (and Google tried to automatically
migrate as much of the content as possible), there are some corner cases
which were served by the former but not by the later (for example it is
my understanding that you can’t create custom HTML / CSS / JS – or
upload arbitrary files for that matter - on Google Sites).

The following blog post offers alternatives to the [google web
hosting](http://www.alreadyhosting.com/blog/2009/06/google-web-hosting-great-alternatives/)
(which would be going with a hosting company – either shared, VPS or
dedicated; buying your own domain name and installing your CMS – or
having someone install it for you). Why I still lean towards the Google
offering:

-   their SLA is still better than most of the industry’s (and certainly
    better than you can achieve by running your own server!)
-   the limited feature set means that they can optimize the heck out of
    it by adding redundancy and load balancing, even across data centers
    – if your server/datacenter fails, you *will* have downtime. In
    contrast hardware failure for Google is a daily thing and the
    services are built to work around it
-   they gave lots of advance warnings that the change was going to
    happen

*Full disclosure: this is a paid review from

understanding I was not obligated to skew my viewpoint in any way (ie.
only post positive facts).*
