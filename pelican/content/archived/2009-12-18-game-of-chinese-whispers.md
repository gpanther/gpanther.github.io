Yet an other example of real-life Chinese whispers in the security
journalism:

A Hungarian online news site published an article titled “[Hackers tried
to steal user data from Amazon](http://hirek.prim.hu/cikk/75929/)” (here
is [a somewhat usable automatic
translation](http://translate.google.com/translate?js=y&prev=_t&hl=en&ie=UTF-8&layout=1&eotf=1&u=http%3A%2F%2Fhirek.prim.hu%2Fcikk%2F75929%2F&sl=hu&tl=en)
for the non-Hungarian speakers). I assume that the information went like
this:

What happened –\> What the security company has written up about it –\>
What the “journalist” understood –\> What s/he actually wrote.

What actually happened is that an Amazon EC2 *rented to a third party*
[was being used as a C&C; server for a
botnet](http://blogs.ict-forward.eu/forward/zeus-botnets-cc-through-amazon-ec2/).
No Amazon user data compromise here, move along (also, [this isn’t a new
phenomenon at
all](http://blog.scansafe.com/journal/2009/12/17/amazon-cloud-has-rained-malware-before.html)).

To top it off, the article talks about the security issues involved in
cloud computing. Surely they are paid by buzzwords / paragraph :-p.

As if you needed further proof that a large percentage of the news out
there is false, even when there is no intent to “spin” it. Newer
attribute to malice what can be explained by stupidity I suppose...
