I’m happy to announce that I’m one of two “spam killers” on the
[Software Engineering radio website](http://www.se-radio.net/). Spam was
starting to run rampant on their site, so they asked for help and I
responded. It is so simple to donate your time to a worthy cause. You to
can do it, it takes just a couple of minutes per day!

PS: If you are interested in software development / design, this is
definitely a podcast you should give a listen.
