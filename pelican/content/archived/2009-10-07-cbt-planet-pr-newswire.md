recently announced their MCITP bootcamps for 2010. MCITP stands for
Microsoft Certified IT Professional, and in good Microsoft tradition, it
doesn’t stand for one certification, but rather a group of
certifications. So we have (list taken from [the Microsoft
site](http://www.microsoft.com/learning/en/us/certification/mcitp.aspx#tab2)):

-   MCITP: Enterprise Desktop Administrator 7
-   MCITP: Consumer Support Technician
-   MCITP: Enterprise Support Technician
-   MCITP: Enterprise Administrator
-   MCITP: Server Administrator
-   MCITP: Database Administrator 2008
-   MCITP: Database Developer 2008
-   MCITP: Business Intelligence Developer 2008
-   MCITP: Database Administrator
-   MCITP: Database Developer
-   MCITP: Business Intelligence Developer
-   MCITP: Enterprise Project Management with Microsoft Office Project
    Server 2007
-   MCITP: Enterprise Messaging Administrator

Again, as with other Microsoft exams, each certification is composed out
of two to three exams. There is absolutely no overlap between the exams
necessary for the different types of certifications, which is somewhat
surprising to me (I’ve briefly looked at the MS certs for developers and
I seem to remember that there is more overlap there – but it is possible
that this is representative for certification structure for the IT part
of MS).

From what I’ve seen on their site, CBT Planet focuses mainly on
providing online, self-paced study possibilities, but it seems that they
are trying to enter into the bootcamp market. As a general rule, I don’t
see the value in bootcamps. The two exceptions would be: if you know
that it is absolutely necessary for the job you are applying for or if
your employer is paying for it (in which case it can be considered an
almost – but – not – quite – vacation). From my experience (based on
participations in a couple of certification programs – no bootcamps
though), anyone somewhat familiar with the subject can pass the final
exams. If you go to the bootcamp: good luck with the exam!
