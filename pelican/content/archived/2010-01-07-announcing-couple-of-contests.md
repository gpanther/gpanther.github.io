Here are some contests I found:

-   [The Fifth Underhanded C
    Contest](http://underhanded.xcott.com/?p=18) – the scope is to write
    benign looking code which would pass trough a code-review (and/or
    there is plausible deniability for the coder), but which does some
    evil things. Found it [via
    slashdot](http://slashdot.org/story/09/12/30/1446221/5th-Underhanded-C-Contest-Now-Open).
    Some of the [previous solutions](http://underhanded.xcott.com/?p=12)
    are truly ingenious.
-   From the Forensics Contest comes [Ann’s
    AppleTV](http://forensicscontest.com/2009/12/28/anns-appletv), where
    you can win ... Ann’s AppleTV of course!
-   [Forensic Practical Exercise
    \#3](http://www.forensickb.com/2010/01/forensic-practical-exercise-3.html)
    – no prizes, just fun (and it isn’t all that simple either!). If you
    don’t own encase, you can transform the provided image into a DD
    style raw image using [the Sleuth
    Kit](http://www.sleuthkit.org/sleuthkit/download.php):

        img_cat.exe -v -i ewf Forensic_Practical_3.E01 > dd.raw

    <p>
    Just consider that the resulting image will be around 4G (because
    the thumb drive it imaged was 4G).

Good luck to everyone!

PS. The current [Ethical Hacker Challenge](/2009/12/new-challenges.html)
is still open until the 11th of January.
