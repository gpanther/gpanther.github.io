You might also want to check out the [Options for
giving](/2010/01/options-for-giving.html) post, which enumerates more
organizations you should consider donating to (not related to the Haiti
earthquake).

As most of you probably already know, the [Republic of
Haiti](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Haiti) has been hit by a
catastrophic earthquake. Please donate to the organizations which are
trying to help. The [online donation has been proven a great
success](http://tech.slashdot.org/story/10/01/15/185231/Digital-Fundraising-Booms-For-Haiti-Relief) -
so good to see the bright side of globalization (speaking of online - it
is an interesting example of how [offline events can be observed
online](http://blog.mozilla.com/metrics/2010/01/14/internet-usage-in-haiti/) -
an other example being the [Google
flu-trends](http://www.google.org/flutrends/)). Below you will find a
compilation of reputable information sources, which is important, since
there are always a lot of scams around important events like this.

*Important!* Most of the information is rather specific to the USA and
most of them presuppose credit-cards. If you live outside of
North-America and have PayPal account, I would recommend donating to the
[Haiti Earthquake Children in Emergency
Fund](http://www.savethechildren.org/get-involved/fundraising-challenges/alt-ways-to-give-earthquake-wpg-haiti-0110.html).
You can get a list of ways you can donate via PayPal/eBay on [their
blog](https://www.thepaypalblog.com/2010/01/how-you-can-help-with-haiti-earthquake-relief-efforts-via-paypal-ebay/).

-   [Doing the Right Thing](http://isc.sans.org/diary.html?storyid=7996)
    from the SANS diary - it gives a couple of very good advices. It
    also specifically lists the following organizations:
    -   [CARE](http://www.care.org/)
    -   [The International Red Cross](http://www.icrc.org/)
    -   [Doctors Without Borders](http://doctorswithoutborders.org/)
-   If you have a Google Checkout account, you can [donate to CARE or
    UNICEF](http://googleblog.blogspot.com/2010/01/posted-by-soandso-soandso-team.html)
    using it. The [Google crisis response
    webpage](http://www.google.com/relief/haitiearthquake/) also lists a
    lot of trustworthy organizations which accept your donation and SMS
    numbers (valid in the USA only!) which can be used for donation.
    They also offer free calls to Haiti trough Google Voice
-   Here are [a couple of great tips from the CERIAS
    blog](http://www.cerias.purdue.edu/site/news/view/scammers_target_givers_after_haiti_earthquake/)
    (written by professor Spafford) to help you avoid being scammed:  

    > -   Do not enter any information at a Web page that pops up
    >     unexpectedly when you visit some other site.
    > -   Never click on a Web site address (URL) in e-mail sent to you;
    >     it may look official, but most will be pointers to fraud or
    >     attack sites.
    > -   Don’t assume that every Web address returned by a search
    >     engine, such as Google or Bing, is a legitimate organization.
    > -   Do not respond to e-mail requesting donations or making a
    >     special offer (such as asking you to hold their assets while
    >     Haiti rebuilds).
    > -   Do not reveal any personal or financial information during a
    >     phone call you did not dial yourself.
    > -   If a friend forwards a URL, phone number or e-mail, don’t
    >     trust it until you check its validity. Your friend may have
    >     been scammed first.

    [Security Balance](http://www.securitybalance.com/2010/01/haiti/)):

    <p>
-   Many community websites also include a suggestion to donate (for
    example
    [reddit.com](http://blog.reddit.com/2010/01/helping-haiti-because-we-ought-to-do.html)
    or [oneforty](http://oneforty.com/)) and you can be reasonably sure
    about their recommendation *if you've been using the site for some
    time* (then again, it never hurts to double-check).
