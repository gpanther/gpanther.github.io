I’m expanding! Not only am I ranting on my own soap box (blog), now you
can read my rants on other blogs as well: fudsec just published my
[Knowing Walls from Speed
Bumps](http://fudsec.com/knowing-walls-from-speed-bumps) rant. Thank
you! If you are fed up with FUD in the security industry, check out the
site and went away! Who knows, maybe we can even change a thing or two
(yeah, righ!).

Thanks again to the [fudsec](http://fudsec.com/) guys for publishing my
“article”.
