I have posted
[reviews](http://hype-free.blogspot.com/2009/10/voipstreet-affiliate-program-review.html)
trough ReviewMe for VoIP products before, but here is an other other
one: Vocalocity is a provider specialized on [small business
voip](http://www.vocalocity.com/small-business-voip/). They’ve been in
business since 2005 and [all the
reviews](http://www.voipreview.org/review/vocalocity) about them [which
I could
find](http://www.whichvoip.com/voip/business-voip-reviews/vocalocity-voip-review.htm)
were glowing (one might suspect foul play given all the good reviews,
but digging deeper some of them mention problems and specify that the
support was very good and helped them trough the hiccups). Of course if
you had a negative experience with them, please share it in the
comments.

An other positive aspect is that their pricing plan is prominently
featured on their webpage, so you should have no problem finding it.
They also pride themselves with not being resellers (“owning their own
technology”) and have a nice office building:

What else is there to say about them? If you are looking for a way to
reduce the complexity of your phone network, take a look at them (of
course, you have to consider other aspects of your business – like what
level of guarantee you need that others won’t access the voicemail – the
assurance you *can* provide in-house is always greater, at a higher cost
of course).

only post positive facts).*
