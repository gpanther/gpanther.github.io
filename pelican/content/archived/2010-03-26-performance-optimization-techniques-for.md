Yesterday I gave a presentation at the [Transylvania
JUG](http://groups.google.com/group/transylvania-jug) about using
profilers and different techniques which you can use to work around the
discovered performance problems. Below you can find the embedded
presentation.

If you are interested in the code samples (as you most probably are,
since a big part of the presentation were demos), you can find them in
[my Google Code SVN
repository](http://code.google.com/p/hype-free/source/browse/#svn/trunk/java-perfopt-201003).
Feel free to contact me if you have questions about the slides or about
something else in general.
