Sorry for being a little late: the [T2’09
challenge](http://www.t2.fi/challenge/) just started. Via [the F-Secure
weblog](http://www.f-secure.com/weblog/archives/00001758.html). Don’t be
fooled by the fact that page already contains two entries (“Mr. Speed”
and “Mr. Style”) in the top. From what I understand, these are to signal
that two winners will be selected, one for speed and one for style.

The page also contains entries from past years for you to play with.
