[scentsy](https://scentsified.scentsy.us/Buy) has an interesting concept
for providing different scents in the room: rather than burning
different materials (like candles or sticks) it uses a lightbulb to heat
the wax. This provides a "smoke-free" way to enjoy your fragrances. An
other advantage of the concept is that it keeps the warm glow of the
candle. If scents are your thing and you don't like the smoke part, give
this a try. Take care however that some people are sensible to strong
scents and they can have adverse reactions (like headache). The electric
system can help here also: you can use an electric timer (easy to find
is most places) to control the dosage. This is also helpful if you are
concerned (as I am) about electric appliances overheating.

A couple of final thoughts:

-   it uses its own checkout system rather than something more known
    like Google Checkout. I would recommend using a one-time creditcard
    (like the ones offered by PayPal) for added safety (I just don't
    feel comfortable giving my creditcard details to small merchants)
-   it has [an A rating on
    BBB](http://www.bbb.org/boise/business-reviews/candles-retail/scentsy-inc-in-meridian-id-5006323/#)
    (which is good)
-   it also has some kind of a referral system. I would strongly advise
    people against participating in such systems, but if the products
    are good, buy them.
