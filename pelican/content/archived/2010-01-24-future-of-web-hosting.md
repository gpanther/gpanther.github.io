I find myself thinking more and more about (a possible) future of the
web.  
While the current system for [web
hosting](http://www.alreadyhosting.com) works pretty well (and I am the
first  
to say that we shouldn't make the perfect an enemy of the good), it
would be  
really nice to exploit more of the potential in the web. What we could
do  
(and we already have the technology!):

Make as many aspects of it fully distributed as possible: this would
mean  
both content lookup (discovery) and hosting: today the average PC uses
very  
little of its resources (whether we are talking about storage,
bandwidth or CPU).  
We could push out content to the "edges" which would result in a better
utilization  
of the local network infrastructure (hence ISP would gain from it) and
faster  
content delivery without compromising secrecy if we so desire using PKI
(hence  
content producers should like it).

As a "sideeffect" we could get an information system which has integrity
built in  
by default (ie. X said Y at moment T - certified by cryptographic
protocols) and  
is highly resistant to censorship (because information is distributed
and encrypted  
by default both in transit and at rest). What a nice place it would be!
