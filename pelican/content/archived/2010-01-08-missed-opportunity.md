The theory of capitalism (and I’m greatly oversimplifying here, I know)
says that, even is we all follow just our own self interest, a global
“good” will somehow emerge. This is what F-Secure is doing [in their
blogpost](http://www.f-secure.com/weblog/archives/00001850.html) where
they write about a specific ransomware which – if you get infected
with - encrypts your data and asks you a certain amount of money to
decrypt it.

Trouble is that their only recommendation is to “<span
class="rss:item">remind everyone to backup their important files
regularly” (coincidentally – sarcasm, sarcasm – they have an online
backup component in their suite). They could have at least mentioned
that [Sunbelt provides a tool which may decrypt the
files](http://sunbeltblog.blogspot.com/2010/01/data-doctor-2010-encrypted-files-we.html)
(I say may, because I didn’t actually try the tool). This is even more
inexplicable given the fact that they got the samples from Sunbelt
(“Many thanks to Adam Thomas from Sunbelt for providing samples of the
dropper”).</span>

<span class="rss:item">Shame on you F-Secure for putting a (possible)
financial interest before the interest of your users!</span>

<span class="rss:item">So I don’t know about you, but instead of
claiming that pure self-interest is the solution, I will go with:</span>

> <span class="rss:item">Everything in moderation - including
> moderation.</span>

<span class="rss:item">PS. Who wants to bet that – if these claims are
bought to F-Secure’s attention – they will claim that they didn’t know
about the removal tool?</span>

*Update*: I'm not singling out F-Secure here, Zarestel Ferrer from CA
just made a [very similar
blogpost](http://community.ca.com/blogs/securityadvisor/archive/2010/01/09/another-recycled-ransomware-datadoctor2010.aspx):
here are the facts (he did include some more technical detail, which is
nice for us, security geeks), you should have used a security product to
keep it out:

> CA advises to keep your security products signature updated to prevent
> this kind of ransomware.

The plus side: he doesn't pimp his company's product necessarily. The
minus: he doesn't link to the Sunbelt decryption tool either. On the
plus side, there is a comment facility on their website which could be
used by visitors to mention the tool and thus help out people who lost
data, but on the negative side: *it doesn't work, not even with IE!*.
