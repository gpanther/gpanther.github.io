I've already [written
about](http://hype-free.blogspot.com/2011/01/scentsy-review.html)
[Scentsy Products](https://scentsified.scentsy.us/), so I will try not
to repeat myself that much (other than reiterating that you should
really think before investing in a referral system) and will focus on
their special product:

[Piece by Piece Full-Size Scentsy
Warmer](https://scentsified.scentsy.us/Buy/ProductDetails/DSW-SFF-ATSM)
– this a usual warmer (usual for Scentsy that is – it uses a lightbulb
to provide the heat, thus avoiding the open flame and smoke) with a
puzzle-piece decoration. What makes this item (more) special is the fact
that parts of the revenue from it go to [Autism
Speaks](http://www.autismspeaks.org/). While currently this is the only
one in the [Charitable Cause
Warmers](http://scentsyfamilyfoundation.org/causewarmer.aspx) product
line, hopefully there will be more in the future, allowing you to get
something for both your body and your soul.

An other item I didn’t talk about in the last article is the gift
certificate: if you consider appropriate, you could give a [25 USD Gift
Certificate](https://scentsified.scentsy.us/Buy/ProductDetails/GC-25) to
the person. There are also [replacement
parts](https://scentsified.scentsy.us/Buy/Category/535) and [individual
warmer parts](https://scentsified.scentsy.us/Buy/Collection/463) if your
warmer breaks but you don’t want to buy a completely new one. Also, the
light bulbs in the Scentsy products are standard ones (compared to
something like a Philips wake-up light) so you can buy a replacement in
almost any store, as long as you watch for the socket size and the
wattage.

*Full disclosure: this is a paid review from ReviewMe. Under the terms
of the understanding I was not obligated to skew my viewpoint in any way
(ie. only post positive facts).*
