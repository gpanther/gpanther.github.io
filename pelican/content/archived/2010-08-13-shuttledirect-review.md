The purpose of this website is to offer prebookable [Airport taxi
transfers](http://www.shuttledirect.com). This means that you can rent a
transportation method to/from the airport before you even embark on your
journey.

Is it worth it? I have to admit that I'm far from being a big traveler,
but until now every airport I've been to offers many ways to travel to
the nearest city which are clearly marked. Also, this site is an
aggregator of local offerings (it doesn't provide the services itself),
which means that the quality may vary between different parts.

The trustlevel I have in the site (since security is a feeling, not some
objective thing for most people) is medium for several reasons:

-   They exist since a long time (since 2002), which is good, but don't
    have the proper SSL setup (which is bad, especially for a site which
    wants to take my money)
-   They [don't run on a dedicated
    server](http://www.domaintools.com/reverse-ip/?hostname=92.52.85.11),
    although probably the other sites hosted on the same server belong
    to the same company (so not as bad as using shared hosting)
-   The different security logos which they present are not linked to
    the respective organizations (you can't click on them to access the
    information the third-party has about the site)

Considering all the above, plus the fact that I never felt the need for
such a service, I am somewhat reticent to recommend it, but it might
work for other people.

*Full disclosure: this is a paid review from

only post positive facts).*
