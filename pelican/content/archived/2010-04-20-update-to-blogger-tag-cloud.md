A small PSE (Public Service Announcement): if you were using the
[Blogger Tag
Cloud](http://hype-free.blogspot.com/2009/03/blogger-tag-cloud.html)
I’ve put together based on the WP-Cumulus plugin, you might have noticed
that it stopped working some time ago (I’m not entirely sure when, since
I didn’t notice it, until a reader commented and brought it to my
attention – thanks again [Soufiane](http://www.leblogger.com/)).

The problem was that the server hosting the SWF and JS file didn’t serve
them anymore, instead giving a 403 – access refused error. To mitigate
this problem I’ve uploaded the SWF file to Google Code and used the JS
file from the Google Ajax Library and bought the plugin back to life.

So, if you are using the plugin and you are subscribed to my feed, go to
the [original (now updated)
post](http://hype-free.blogspot.com/2009/03/blogger-tag-cloud.html) and
use the new code.

Thank you and sorry for any inconvenience caused!
