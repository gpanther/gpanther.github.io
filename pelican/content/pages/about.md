Title: About
Save_as: index.html

I'm a father, a husband, and software craftsman interested in bettering myself, exploring the bounds of the industry and solving problems in the most efficient way possible.

My current focus is optimizing systems performance by taking a holistic view of software and hardware stack.

I'm always interested in new opportunities.
